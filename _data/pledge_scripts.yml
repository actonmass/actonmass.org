  Hi! My name is \_\_\_\_\_ and I'm a constituent of Rep./Sen. \_\_\_\_\_. I'm
  calling to ask that they sign the Act on Mass transparency pledge. This
  simple, straightforward pledge would improve MA government by letting me know
  how they vote on important bills and ensure the public has more transparency
  in what is happening on Beacon Hill.


  #### Talking points:


  * **"The Rep doesn't sign pledges, pledges don't mean anything."** >> This pledge DOES mean something, it means you are pledging to make your own votes public. This is easy to do and I don't understand why the Rep wouldn't sign this.
