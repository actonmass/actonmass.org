  - title: Won't Single-payer Healthcare cost too much?
    text: "**No**, in fact a Single-payer healthcare system will save up to $21 billion per year.  Much of that cost savings come from reduced insurance company overhead.  Instead of paying premiums, co-pays, and a litany of other confusing charges, you will pay a small tax -- smaller than what you're already paying for healthcare."
