    title: In the 190th Session (2017-2018), a bill by Rep. Bensen was introduced to
      study the costs of a single payer healthcare system. The bill was
      “combined” with many other Healthcare bills in H4605, but without the
      single payer benchmark study.

questions:
  - title: Won't Single-payer Healthcare cost too much?
    text: "**No**, in fact a Single-payer healthcare system will save up to $21
      billion per year.  Much of that cost savings come from reduced insurance
      company overhead.  Instead of paying premiums, co-pays, and a litany of
      other confusing charges, you will pay a small tax -- smaller than what
      you're already paying for healthcare."
  - title: Will Medicare for All increase wait times and result in rationing care?
    text: "**No.** Studies show that countries with universal single-payer health
      care systems have on average lower wait times than the United States.
      Patients are also no longer restricted to seeking care from providers that
      are in their insurance network, so the range of options patients enjoy are
      larger under a single-payer system. This enables providers to be able to
      keep up with demand, instead of having to work around the artificial
      limits that insurance companies place on patients and providers."
