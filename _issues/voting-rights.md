## Our challenge

### 16 states and DC have Same Day Voter Registration [1]

#### Including most other New England states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut

Yet Massachusetts requires **voters to register 20 days before election day to vote** [2]. This disenfranchises voters who move often: young people, people of color, and low-income people.

As the most diverse state in New England and our large student population, Same Day Voter Registration is a no-brainer that increases turnout [3].

## Our choice

### Bill: Election Day Registration [4]

The Election Day Registration bill has consistently been filed  **since 2005 [5] and has not passed despite our democratic supermajority**.

Why are Democrats in favor of barriers to voting?

Massachusetts comes in **last place for competitive elections** [6]. Conservative Democrats in power have thwarted efforts to expand the electorate and have kept in place the old boys club and a toxic culture of intimidation to “wait your turn”. Change can’t wait, [watch this three minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRz1abFUrA8)  for more.
