failures:
  - title: Out of control Wage Theft
    text: Wage Theft is a huge problem in our country, outweighing all other types
      of theft by a wide margin. It's easy for bosses to withhold pay unfairly,
      and hard for workers to get restitution.
  - title: Fair Scheduling
    text: Retail and shift workers can be forced into shifts with late notice, or
      forced to close one night and open the next morning, causing many workers
      who may have children or other obligations to choose between their
      unpredictable schedules and the rest of their lives. Mandating some
      regularity and advance notice for shifts can make these jobs more
      accessible to parents with children, workers who are taking care of a sick
      family member, students, and others for who an unpredictable work schedule
      would cause instability.
questions:
  - title: Is wage theft really a problem?
    text: "**Yes**. Wage theft, which is money employers are obligated on paper to
      pay their workers but haven't, is the largest form of theft in this
      country, and steals more from American workers annually than all reported
      robberies combined."
