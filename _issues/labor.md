failures:
  - title: Out of control Wage Theft
    text: Wage Theft is a huge problem in our country, outweighing all other types
      of theft by a wide margin. It's easy for bosses to withhold pay unfairly,
      and hard for workers to get restitution.
  - title: Fair Scheduling
    text: Retail and shift workers can be forced into shifts with late notice, or
      forced to close one night and open the next morning. Mandating some
      regularity and advance notice for shifts can make these jobs workable for
      people
questions:
  - title: Is Wage Theft really a problem?
    text: Yes! Wage Theft (money employers should have payed workers, but didn't) is
      the largest form of theft in this country, dwarfing the total amount of
      money stolen in robberies of all kinds.
