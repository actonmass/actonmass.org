## Our challenge

### Climate change is real and our environment is in crisis [1]

#### The science is clear: we are running out of time to address climate change

{% include issues/numbers.html numbers=page.our_challenge_numbers %}

#### Much of Boston will be underwater by the end of this century at current rates of emissions [5]


## Our choice

### 100% renewable energy by 2050 [6]

This bill was sent to the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy in January 2017. 17 months later, at the end of the session, the bill was “sent to study,” a common tactic to kill the bill.

What’s wrong with sending a bill to study? That seems reasonable!

The “study order” process in the MA is manipulated to lack any accountability. It’s a way to kill bills without voting it down outright. When bills are “sent to study,” the studies almost never produce results or reports, and the bills are dead until next session.

No study was reported by the committee’s Dec 31st 2018 deadline [7].

## Common questions


> Doesn’t Massachusetts have a good record on the environment?

-   Massachusetts has historically been a leader in this area, but in recent years we have fallen behind. But regardless of where we fall on any rankings, the bottom line is that our current policies are too weak and will lead to catastrophic outcomes.

-   Our  [latest clean energy bill](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H4857)  has been widely criticized by climate advocates including the Sierra Club. The State Senate passed a strong bill, but the final legislation was [watered down significantly](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/07/31/massachusetts-committee-produces-weaker-energy-bill/), mostly to match the weaker bills from the House of Representatives.

-   Funding for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) has declined by over 30% since 2001;


> Isn’t climate a federal issue? What can state reps actually do about it?


-   States play a major role in environmental protection, and their role is even more important when we cannot depend on our federal government to take action. States are responsible for setting their own renewable energy targets, and many states also set their own fuel economy standards.
