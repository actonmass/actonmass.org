  - title: Doesn’t Massachusetts have a good record on the environment?
    text: >
      Massachusetts has historically been a leader in this area, but in recent
      years we have fallen behind. But regardless of where we fall on any
      rankings, the bottom line is that our current policies are too weak and
      will lead to catastrophic outcomes.


      Our  [latest clean energy bill](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H4857)  has been widely criticized by climate advocates including the Sierra Club. The State Senate passed a strong bill, but the final legislation was [watered down significantly](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/07/31/massachusetts-committee-produces-weaker-energy-bill/), mostly to match the weaker bills from the House of Representatives.


      Funding for the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) has declined by over 30% since 2001;
  - title: Isn’t climate a federal issue? What can state reps actually do about it?
    text: States play a major role in environmental protection, and their role is
      even more important when we cannot depend on our federal government to
      take action. States are responsible for setting their own renewable energy
      targets, and many states also set their own fuel economy standards.
