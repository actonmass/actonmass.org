catchphrase: Massachusetts hasn't done enough to end mass incarceration and a
  police force that's out of control

failures:
  - title: Mandatory Minimum Sentences
    text: Mandatory minimum sentences don't work, they just serve to swell our
      prison populations for no reason. Our legislature had a chance to end
      mandatory minimums when they passed a CJR bill back in 2018, but they left
      mandatory minimums in place and even created a few new ones.
  - title: Desperate Need for Police Reform
    text: Massachusetts is just a handful of states without certification for
      officers, meaning that a cop who's fired by one town for misbehavior can
      get a job down the road in the next town. This is outrageous.
      Springfield's police department is so bad that even Trump's DOJ paid
      attention, starting an investigation into unconstitutional policing and
      systemic misconduct.
questions:
  - title: Isn’t Massachusetts really progressive on criminal justice?
    text: >
      It’s a mixed bag. Massachusetts has a low overall incarceration rate, but
      some of the worst racial disparities. We have also been criticized for
      [sending more paroled prisoners back to prison than
      Texas](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2019/01/02/parole/?fbclid=IwAR1pVj1CJBGRyKWgUAW5SO6vcln-DW4ocCIMpltGnqKJr838RFRE_X5OL9M).
      While other states are certainly worse, Massachusetts has serious problems
      with its criminal justice system. Remember: even progressive U.S. states
      lock up more people than most other countries.
  - title: If we just passed a major bill, doesn’t that mean the legislature is
      doing a good job?
    text: >
      We passed major reforms because advocacy works. Our legislature spent
      several years failing to act on mass incarceration after passing “tough on
      crime” legislation in the Clinton years. Activists spent multiple
      legislative sessions trying to push the legislature to do something and
      they finally did, but that is not what a progressive legislature looks
      like!


      And here’s the thing: inequities in our justice system typically follow other injustices in society.  Our legislature has been mostly silent on the things that would make sentencing reform most effective: housing, health care, and education.
