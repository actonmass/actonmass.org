questions:
  - title: Is sex education really a necessary part of a comprehensive public school
      education?
    text: "**Yes.** Learning about consent, about the reproductive system, and about
      contraception and healthy practices is a crucial part of development for
      young adults, and for LGBTQ+ teens it's essential that gender-affirming
      care and education begins in public schools. Comprehensive sex education
      based on science and research has shown to lower STD rates among young
      people, reduced risks of unwanted pregnancy, and reduced rates
      nonconsensual sex and sexual assault."
