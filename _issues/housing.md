questions:
  - title: Isn’t Home Rule a good thing to ensure that the State enacts reasonable
      policies?
    text: >
      **No**. A 2007 report by the Rapaport Insitute at Harvard found that
      Massachusetts has a uniquely restrictive legal framework governing how
      cities can govern themselves. No other cities they studied were as limited
      in law-making power as Boston (or other Massachusetts cities).


      The authors note: “Because the Home Rule Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution exempts taxing, borrowing, the regulation of private and civil affairs, and municipal elections from its scope, Boston has less authority than the six other major U.S. cities we examined. For example, the Illinois Constitution grants municipalities home rule powers that pertain to local matters and then expressly defines them in an expansive fashion.1 As a result, Chicago has the power to tax, the power to borrow, and the power to “regulate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare . ...”2 Moreover, the Illinois Constitution provides—as the Massachusetts Constitution does not—that the “[p]owers and functions of home rule units shall be construed liberally.”3 Consistent with that instruction, the Illinois Supreme Court has construed the grant of home rule to include the power to regulate municipal elections, including the authority to require them to be nonpartisan.4 Similarly, none of the other cities we studied operates under a grant of home rule that exempts taxing, borrowing, the regulation of private or civil affairs, and the regulation of municipal elections from its coverage.”

  - title: Doesn't rent control just limit the building of new housing?
    text: "**No.** Rent control works to keep people in their homes. Studies have
      shown that rent control increases the probability of tenants continuing to
      stay at their address, promoting long-term stability and strengthening
      communities. While there is a shortage of housing available to bring a
      true end to the housing crisis, the shortage is due to loopholes in the
      law that allow land speculation and displacement in the interest of
      profit, as well as systemic underfunding of public housing."
  - title: Is there anything the Legislature can do to protect tenants after the
      eviction moratorium ends?
    text: "**Yes.** While the eviction moratorium, which expires on October 17, is
      preventing the wave of evictions right now, it's a temporary solution to a
      long-term problem. We need a full ban on evictions that lasts the length
      of the pandemic and tenant protections, such as lifting the ban on rent
      control and an end to no-fault evictions."
