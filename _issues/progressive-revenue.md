catchphrase: "Massachusetts residents overwhelmingly support eliminating the tax
  cuts of recent decades. Progressive taxation would raise desperately needed
  revenue and redistribute wealth to communities that have been cut-out of the
  economy. "

    text: In recent decades, state and local tax rates in Massachusetts have fallen
      by more than in any other state except for Arizona and Arkansas. Across
      the board, tax rates have been slashed. Starting In the late 1990s, tax
      rates on salaries, dividends, and capital gains were steeply reduced. In
      2008, legislators agreed to reduce corporate income tax rates. Today,
      those with the highest income contribute the least, with the poorest 20%
      of earners contributing nearly 50% more of their salaries to the state
      budget than the top 1%.
  - title: Stop austerity budget logic
    text: The Massachusetts General Laws mandate that the annual budget must be
      balanced. Using this fact as a wedge, state legislators tend to underfund
      public priorities before raising taxes. Raising revenue must be our first
      instinct in MA, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has
      disproportionately harmed communities of color and lower-income families.
  - title: The solution is hidden in plain sight
    text: Economic injustice stems from bad government policy, not intractable
      market forces or economic cycles. A system of progressive taxation, in
      which the wealthy pay higher taxes than working families, is the most
      powerful tool available for building and maintaining a just economy.
questions:
  - title: "Won’t raising tax rates kill jobs, stifle innovation and disincentivize
      work? "
    text: >-
      The dominant economic trend in recent decades is escalating inequality,
      underpinned by steep tax cuts and declining rates of economic growth. Our
      economy is not working. When an economy is rigged in favor of the wealthy,
      the large salaries captured by certain workers vastly surpass their
      contribution to society, starving the economy of capital and cutting-out
      entire groups of workers. The function of a progressive tax agenda is to
      prevent wealth and income disparities from making economies dysfunctional.


      In other words, a low tax regime, not a progressive one, destroys jobs and stifles innovation. The median family wealth of communities of color in the Greater Boston area is effectively $0. No person can claim to possess self-determination, let alone afford to take risk, when fundamental resources and human rights are kept out of reach. Public investment in high-quality education, sustainable infrastructure, housing, and healthcare all require raising tax revenue and a system of progressive taxation is the most efficient and fair way to do so.
  - title: If the corporate income tax rate is increased, will businesses relocate
      to other states?
    text: >-
      Corporations consider a long list of factors when deciding where to locate
      operations, including quality of life for employees, the skill base of the
      labor force, public infrastructure, the health of the local economy, and
      access to financing. The general consensus is that tax incentives, whether
      tax credits or tax cuts, play a measurable, yet modest role in a
      corporation’s decision to invest in any particular state.


      Massachusetts is a highly desirable state for business investment as a result of public investment. According to the Best States for Business List published by Forbes Magazine, Massachusetts ranks 4th for quality of life and 5th for labor supply. Further, only eight states have a lower total effective business tax rate. We must not fall prey to misleading capital strikes by corporations when they threaten to undermine the public budgets.
