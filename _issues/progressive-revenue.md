catchphrase: "Massachusetts residents overwhelmingly support eliminating the tax
  cuts of recent decades. Progressive taxation would raise desperately needed
  revenue and redistribute wealth to communities that have been cut-out of the
  economy. "

  - title: "A crumbling and upside down tax system "
    text: In recent decades, state and local tax rates in Massachusetts have fallen
      by more than in any other state except for Arizona and Arkansas. Across
      the board, tax rates have been slashed. Starting In the late 1990s, tax
      rates on salaries, dividends, and capital gains were steeply reduced. In
      2008, legislators agreed to reduce corporate income tax rates. Today,
      those with the highest income contribute the least, with the poorest 20%
      of earners contributing nearly 50% more of their salaries to the state
      budget than the top 1%.
  - title: "Defeated policies "
    text: Economic injustice stems from bad government policy, not intractable
      market forces or economic cycles. A system of progressive taxation, in
      which the wealthy pay higher taxes than working families, is the most
      powerful tool available for building and maintaining a just economy.
  - title: Stop austerity budget logic
    text: The Massachusetts General Laws mandate that the annual budget must be
      balanced. Using this fact as a wedge, state legislators tend to underfund
      public priorities before raising taxes. Raising revenue must be our first
      instinct in MA, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has
      disproportionately harmed communities of color and lower-income families.
