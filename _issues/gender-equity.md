failures:
  - title: Abortion Access
    text: There are still serious gaps in abortion access even in Massachusetts. We
      should be leading the country on this issue given threats at the Federal
      level
  - title: Childcare equity
    text: Massachusetts doesn't allow parents running for office to pay for
      childcare expenses with campaign funds, shutting out many parents
      especially mothers from running for office.
  - title: Buying Silence
    text: It's still all too common for companies to use non-disclosure agreements
      to force survivors of sexual violence into silence. We must end this
      practice
