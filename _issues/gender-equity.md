## Our challenge

### Massachusetts is 1 of 26 states with no standards for sex-ed in public schools [1]


- 28% of U.S. youth ages 14 to 17 had been sexually victimized [2]
- Girls ages 16-19 are 4x more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault [3]


In the era of #metoo, we must protect **our youth, fight rape culture, and teach consent.**

## Our choice

### The Healthy Youth Act - Create a Culture of Consent

It requires sex-ed taught in public schools be:

- grounded in fact and science
- teach about consent and healthy relationships
- and be LGBTQ affirming [4]

**93% of Massachusetts voters agree** sex-ed should teach consent [5] yet...

...The bill has been killed by the House for 8 years despite the Senate overwhelmingly voting in favor of the bill.
