If you’ve followed our coverage of the State House, you’ve seen how things are done. Important bills sit for months with no action, progressive legislation is frequently killed without a public vote, and decisions are made in secret. Session was extended this year to deal with the budget, but there’s almost no hope for any of the keybills we’ve been tracking -- like the Safe Communities Act, Healthy Youth Act, or repealing the statewide ban on rent control.

In January, these same bills will need to be re-filed. Activists will need to go through the whole process again of gaining co-sponsors and building outside public pressure, with little insight into what’s really going to happen to the bills. This glacial, secretive process is considered ok in the State House. It’s just “how things are done.”

But there’s reason for hope. Last January, [more Reps than ever voted in favor of greater transparency](https://hs-6201350.t.hubspotstarter-i0.net/e2t/tc/VW3ltm4Y4jPHW1NSkWn8KqJ3_W7jDgJ34dBkwPN50kgNL3lGmQV1-WJV7CgL6PW8YSYqR5dSm96W88mjFC90wrT8VlFrr_1GYDbZW3rdGqp66qnp7W4Q8rV_4h95SRW2wtP7C8zdhDTW8YfHmc7XJThRW7vCwFZ4MZpv_W22vMZg3MXYHXW6vm0h39dRyJSF3bYwjvbBQKW88JRkk6b7ymCW1B9dWH1H5c0TN5FCPnxmn6_bW7HSN377sKqtPW2MvXGR45dBXZW4kS05R54SJy9Vv89xY7Z6-YyW1MflrY7NWYfZW73pwTL6jz4pcW6ndTv73bPDcmW2JZ2xF8n1JND3h_M1) in the way votes are conducted, and there’s real momentum to make change in the next year, including dozens of legislators and candidates who have [signed our transparency pledge](https://hs-6201350.t.hubspotstarter-i0.net/e2t/tc/VW3ltm4Y4jPHW1NSkWn8KqJ3_W7jDgJ34dBkwPN50kgNr3lGmwV1-WJV7CgFVvW1fRh2w1SH5YzW4wpns85G8L0cW69bST84lYTZKW28z1lq69YnTVW1Nl8Cw8sMYZVN6v-5jzKGwP8W6wn5hn6m04TlW1jvwDJ8HCgMmW6Lz9Bf1RMFgTW7q1FqP7Hl2MkW4HP5dN7kmWZ6W7qGYfr5n346FW1y7HKc72ZJ0gW8Mrj_47SL804W2TKKTq2S-tLQW8Hzp8h4bnp7bW8srYWl6FFDyZW3Yksn_2WW-GSVlvLTj9hdgDBW5GjzP-4pnTDC32K81).

We believe some of the candidates for office this year will help build on that momentum and help open up the State House so that we can pass the progressive bills our state deserves.

**That’s why we’re proud to announce the following endorsements for State Rep to keep the momentum going. Check out their websites for more ways to help in advance of the September 1st primary.**
