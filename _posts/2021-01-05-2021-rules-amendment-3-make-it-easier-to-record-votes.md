## What does the amendment do?

* It lowers the number of Reps required to force a vote to be recorded from 16 to 8

You can read the full language of our amendment [here](https://actonmass.org/assets/RulesAmendment3.pdf).

## How do we stack up to other states?

Votes are not recorded in the MA House unless 16 Representatives stand and request it. That's more than the number in 40 other states. This makes it harder for votes to be recorded in our state than most others.

(In the chart below, MA is ranked behind 3 other states who also require 16 Reps in normal circumstances, because MA requires a set percentage of elected representatives while these other states require a percentage of present representatives. So in circumstances where several Reps aren't present, it there would only be 15 or less required)
