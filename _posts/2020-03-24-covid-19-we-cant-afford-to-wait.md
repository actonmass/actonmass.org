## Massachusetts isn't doing enough

Since Gov. Baker declared a state of Emergency this month, our state legislature has passed a handful of bills:

* They allocated $15 Million to a fund to deal with the effects of Covid-19
* They waived the one-week waiting period for newly unemployed people to collect benefits
* They delayed a few special elections & allowed for voting by mail (but only through June - this won't help us during the September primary or November elections)

The $15M that the legislature has allocated to fight coronavirus is a drop in the bucket compared to the size of the problem. [Unemployment has skyrocketed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-jobless-claims-states.html?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_RyZ66dxQZgSfTDAeTdxmjOOhKDRT7c04ySIYLtAwiK2Rcchb-29diWdjzbI8t7JUhecI) overnight as businesses have closed and people stay at home. **This is going to hit everyone in MA hard, especially the most vulnerable:**

Unlike previous recessions which ramped up more gradually, this economic crisis will have immediate & disastrous consequences for many in our state. The $15M which the legislature appropriated for this crisis isn't enough. We **need to see** **bold action by our legislature IMMEDIATELY** in order to blunt the damaging effects this crisis will have on the vulnerable in our state.

A number of legislators have filed bills to address various aspects of the crisis, but it's not clear precisely how the legislature will take action. **Whether through many bills or one larger supplemental budget bill, we need to see action FAST.**

## What should the legislature do?

* **✅Cash payments to residents:** HD.4945 by Rep. Gouveia & HD.4950 by Rep. Miranda would provide for cash payments to most residents in the state, helping blunt the impact of job loss, caring for sick relatives, and more. Something to get cash into people's hands urgently is needed. These bills both include means testing, but we would urge the legislature to not means test these payments, as it is not just families in deep poverty who are at risk.
* **✅Eviction/foreclosure moratorium:** HD.4935 by Rep. Connolly & Rep. Honan ensures no evictions or foreclosures happen during the state of emergency. (The MA Housing Court has taken some action, but there are still many people not covered by that action)
* **✅Unemployment insurance:** HD.4958 by Rep Mark & Rep. Sabadosa to expand who is eligible for unemployment insurance to cover people like tipped workers & others.
* **✅Paid Sick Time:** We must expand the current paid sick leave law to ensure all employees have an additional 15 days of paid sick time to self-isolate or care for sick relatives. No one should be forced to choose between having money for rent and taking care of their health.
* **✅Protecting the incarcerated**: HD.4963 by Rep. Sabadosa would work to reduce the chances of a dangerous outbreak of coronavirus in the prison system by releasing people who don't pose a threat and ensuring those who remain are given access to cleaning materials. There are already cases of Covid-19 reported in our correctional systems, we must ensure they do not spread.
* ✅**Vote by Mail:** HD.4957 by Rep. Mark & Rep. Sabadosa to allow anyone to request an absentee ballot and mail it back, to ensure no one has to choose between voting and following social distancing protocols. (The legislature passed vote by mail for special elections, but nothing for the Sept. or Nov elections!)

**Existing MA programs should have funding increased and ensure that vulnerable residents have access:**

* ✅ [Massachusetts Emergency Food Assistance Program](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-emergency-food-assistance-program-mefap?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_RyZ66dxQZgSfTDAeTdxmjOOhKDRT7c04ySIYLtAwiK2Rcchb-29diWdjzbI8t7JUhecI) to ensure residents have access to food. 
* ✅[Residential Assistance for Families in Transition](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/learn-about-residential-assistance-for-families-in-transition-raft?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_RyZ66dxQZgSfTDAeTdxmjOOhKDRT7c04ySIYLtAwiK2Rcchb-29diWdjzbI8t7JUhecI) - Financial assistance to households at risk of homelessness
* ✅ SNAP - Food Stamps
* ✅ MassHealth 
* ✅ Funding for Community Health Centers & Hospitals
* ✅ Local aid to cities & towns - to support first responders, public health, and other necessary programs.
