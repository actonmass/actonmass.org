title: It's harder to get a recorded vote in Massachusetts than in Texas, Ohio, Arizona and Florida  
---

In Massachusetts, it is exceptionally hard to get a recorded vote when bills are voted on by the full House. When comparable states only require 1 to 5 Reps to stand to get a recorded vote on the floor, **Massachusetts requires a whopping 16 Reps or 10% of the legislature.**

Getting 16 Reps to coordinate is hard, and this [presents a challenge to Reps who want to get votes on the record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xflRK0RWOZ4&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_n0A-ifVjLenrEL7ESW-xTAic0k15Z105jABLurmvfcYJxqTL9asZ4fE8Pomal8RHVLNzw). This is why Massachusetts records so few meaningful votes. And when we do, it's almost always unanimous or straight down the party line.

**Lack of transparency leads to bad laws**
------------------------------------------

Why does it matter if we record votes?  Isn't the legislature passing amazing progressive legislation all the time?

No. When votes aren't made public, it leads to a disconnect between what voters want and what our government does.

In 2018, when the House raised the minimum wage to $15/hour, they also removed retail workers' time-and-a-half pay on Sundays and Holidays.  Many retail workers depend on that time-and-a-half pay to make ends meet, and so the law didn't make a meaningful difference in their take home pay. 

There was an amendment to save time-and-a-half, but because it didn't get a recorded vote, you don't know who was on your side or not.  We don't even know how close it was! Had there been a recorded vote on the issue it's likely many Reps would have opposed ending time-and-a-half. But without a roll call, it's easy for Reps to claim they individually opposed the change without having to take a stand in public.

Also, in 2018, during the Criminal Justice Reform debate, the House added a new mandatory minimum sentence into the bill without a recorded vote. At a time when criminal justice advocates were seeking to [remove *all* mandatory minimums because they don't work](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/5-charts-show-mandatory-minimum-sentences-dont-work?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_n0A-ifVjLenrEL7ESW-xTAic0k15Z105jABLurmvfcYJxqTL9asZ4fE8Pomal8RHVLNzw), Massachusetts added a new one that Republicans were pushing for. It's hard to believe the amendment would have passed if Reps were on the record, and that's precisely why it was passed without a recorded vote.

**Democrats aren't all the same and we deserve to know which ones are fighting for our issues**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We know among Democrats there's a wide range of views on important issues. But in terms of recorded votes, we rarely get to see any difference between the [most conservative Democrat who called a group of Black Lives Matter protestors "terrorists"](https://www.masslive.com/news/2015/07/state_house_bills_seek_to_up_p.html?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_n0A-ifVjLenrEL7ESW-xTAic0k15Z105jABLurmvfcYJxqTL9asZ4fE8Pomal8RHVLNzw) and the most progressive Democrats who [stood up to their colleagues to file a bill addressing sexual harassment in the State House](https://www.gazettenet.com/workplace-harassment-legislation-30576330?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_n0A-ifVjLenrEL7ESW-xTAic0k15Z105jABLurmvfcYJxqTL9asZ4fE8Pomal8RHVLNzw).

Unfortunately, there's no way for the public to make any distinction between conservative and progressive Democrats because there are so few recorded votes. As a result, almost everything before a bill becomes law is decided behind closed doors. 

**We can get more recorded votes if more reps stand for roll call**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As of now, 12 Reps are committed to standing for roll call on bills they have co-sponsored. Those 12 Reps are committed to getting more recorded votes on issues we all care about but they need your help. Without 4 more Reps standing with them, they can't get a roll call because we need 16. Join the hundreds of other activists and voters who organized constituent meetings with their Reps to demand they tell us how they vote.
