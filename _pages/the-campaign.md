# **VOTERS DESERVE TO KNOW CAMPAIGN**

At the start of every two year legislative session, the State House writes its own rulebook. A new session begins in January. Over the next few months, we’re organizing constituent power in every corner of the state to demand that our legislators change the broken, anti-democratic rules in the State House.
