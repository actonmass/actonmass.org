# The Questions

A bill to move Massachusetts to 100% Renewable Energy hasn't made any progress in our legislature over the last 3 years. Worse, it's been defeated in committee without a public vote. A majority of all legislators have co-sponsored the bill, indicating they support it, but it can't get a majority in committee?  That doesn't make sense.

To pass this climate bill, we need to make the legislative committee process more transparent. You deserve to know how your elected representatives are voting!

1. ## **Climate**

   Shall the representative for this district be instructed to vote in favor of legislation that would require Massachusetts to achieve 100% renewable energy use within the next two decades, starting immediately and making significant progress within the first five years while protecting impacted workers and businesses?
2. ## **Democracy**

Shall the representative for this district be instructed to vote in favor of changes to the Legislature's rules that would make the results of all votes in Legislative committees publicly available on the Legislature's website?
