### Persuasion Script: For reps who have not yet committed to the Transparency Amendments

Hi, my name is (NAME) and I'm a resident of your district at (ADDRESS/NEIGHBORHOOD) in (CITY). 

I'm writing/calling to ask that you publicly commit to voting in favor of three amendments that would make the State House more transparent and accountable to the public: making all votes and testimony held in committee available to the public, mandating that all bills are publicly available for 72 hours prior to a vote, and reducing the threshold for a floor vote to be publicly recorded in the House of Representatives from 16 state representatives to 8. 

These amendments would make it easier for citizens to know what their reps are doing and how the Legislature's decisions affect them. The State House’s current lack of transparency is preventing the public from their right to be included in the democratic process, and we can’t achieve the change we need without working people having a seat at the table. 

As a legislator who was elected to represent the voices of the district, I hope you will choose to empower your constituents and vote in favor of these three amendments. 

Thank you.

### Thank You Script: For reps who have committed to one or all of the Transparency Amendments

Hi, my name is (NAME) and I'm a resident of your district at (ADDRESS/NEIGHBORHOOD) in (CITY). 

I'm writing/calling to thank you for committing to vote in favor of the Transparency Amendment(s) that would make the State House more transparent and accountable to the public! Namely, \[making all votes and testimony held in committee available to the public / mandating that all bills are publicly available for 72 hours prior to a vote / reducing the threshold for a floor vote to be publicly recorded in the House of Representatives from 16 state representatives to 8].

I support these/this amendment(s) because these/this change(s) would make it easier for citizens to know what their reps are doing and how the Legislature's decisions affect them. Thank you for being courageous and fighting for your constituents’ right to be involved in the democratic process. I am grateful that we have you as an ally in the fight to give working people a seat at the table. 

I look forward to your continued leadership on this issue!

Thank you.
