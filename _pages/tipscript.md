# Feb 24th - Act for Public Committee Votes

The Speaker recently announced rules would be delayed until July, but late on Friday, his office told Reps that they’d be voting on the joint rules (not the House rules) to allow for committees to be set up and start holding hearings. That vote will happen on Wednesday. This won’t affect our amendments #2 & #3 (Those apply only to the House-only rules that the Speaker delayed until July). But it will impact our rule change #1: public committee votes & testimony. It’s important that during this vote, they include the changes we’ve all been fighting for.

Fortunately, the Senate passed joint rules earlier this month that do just that. The House should pass language that matches the Senate and ensures committee votes & testimony are public, including study orders and electronic polls. The House waited to announce this until late on Friday, and we still don’t have a complete picture of what language they will be advancing (The House Rules committee could choose to adopt the Senate language or more likely, insist on less transparency).

## No Public Commitment: For reps who have not yet committed to the Transparency is Power Amendment #1 for Public Committee Votes & Testimony

Hi, my name is (NAME) and I'm a resident of your district at (ADDRESS/NEIGHBORHOOD) in (CITY). 

I'm writing/calling to ask that you advocate for a joint rules package that would make committee votes, including study orders, as well as testimony public and available on the website for all joint committees.

I strongly believe that constituents deserve to see how their reps vote in committees as well as what testimony is influencing their decision, and this would do just that. The State House’s current lack of transparency prevents the public from being included in the democratic process, and we can’t have a healthy democracy without everyday people having a seat at the table. 

As a legislator who was elected to represent the voices of the district, I hope you will choose to empower your constituents and support these measures. 

Thank you.
