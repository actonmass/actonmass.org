### No Public Commitment: For reps who have not yet committed to the Transparency is Power Amendment #1 for Public Committee Votes & Testimony

Hi, my name is (NAME) and I'm a resident of your district at (ADDRESS/NEIGHBORHOOD) in (CITY). 

I'm writing/calling to ask that you vote for amendment X to the joint rules making committee votes and testimony public for all joint committees. This amendment matches the language the Senate adopted in S.14 on Feb. 11, and clarifies that it applies to study orders.

I strongly believe that constituents deserve to see how their reps vote in committees as well as what testimony is influencing their decision, and this amendment would do just that. The State House’s current lack of transparency prevents the public from being included in the democratic process, and we can’t have a healthy democracy without everyday people having a seat at the table. 

As a legislator who was elected to represent the voices of the district, I hope you will choose to empower your constituents and vote in favor of this amendment. 

Thank you.
