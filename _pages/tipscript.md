# Feb 24th - Act for Public Committee Votes

**Please call your State Rep to ask him/her to vote for amendment #8 "Public Committee Votes & Testimony"  More info below.**

Earlier this month, the State Senate passed a version of rules that took a big step forward for state house transparency by including almost everything we’ve been asking for in our 1st point of the Transparency is Power campaign. The Senate rules would make all joint committee votes publicly available on the State House Website & made all testimony made to committees available to the public. You would be able to see, on the bill page, a simple easy-to-understand grid that lets you know how all the individuals on a committee voted (see example below).

The Senate sent its version of the rules to the House last week for a vote this Wednesday. Over the weekend and early this week, the House reviewed and stripped out most of the transparency measures in the Senate version, introducing a bill that is much weaker in a number of key ways:

The House version wouldn’t publish a full record of committee votes. Instead, they are proposing to list on the legislature’s website the aggregate total of members who voted yes, didn’t vote, and reserved their rights (think “abstained”). And they would only publish the names of legislators who voted no.
The House version completely strikes the requirement to make testimony publicly available. The Senate had included provisions to allow the committee to redact sensitive personal information, information that could jeopardize the health or safety of a person.
The House rejected a provision added by the Senate to provide a full week of notice to the public before committee hearings are held. Currently there’s only a 3 day notice period required.

This is disappointing. Thousands of voters all across the state have gotten involved in our Transparency is Power campaign because they believe we should have a simple, easy-to-understand grid showing how each member of committees voted on important legislation, and that testimony should be public.

But we have a chance to change that. Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven has agreed to file an amendment which would restore the excellent language of the Senate and clarify that all votes to send bills to study should also be included. (Approximately half of all bills in the legislature are sent to study each session. We deserve to know how our Reps are voting on all bills, not just half)

Hi, my name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(NAME) and I'm a resident of your district at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(ADDRESS/NEIGHBORHOOD) in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(CITY). 

I'm writing/calling to **ask that you vote for amendment # 8 "Public Committee Votes & Testimony"** to H.68 (the joint rules) making committee votes and testimony public for all joint committees. This amendment matches the language the Senate adopted, and clarifies that it applies to study orders.

**Please vote for amendment #8 and if there is still time, please "quill on" and co-sponsor the amendment.**

I strongly believe that constituents deserve to see how their reps vote in committees as well as what testimony is influencing their decision, and this amendment would do just that. The State House’s current lack of transparency prevents the public from being included in the democratic process, and we can’t have a healthy democracy without everyday people having a seat at the table. 

As a legislator who was elected to represent the voices of the district, I hope you will choose to empower your constituents and vote in favor of this amendment. 

Thank you.
