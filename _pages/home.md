Year after year, popular bills about education, immigrant rights, climate change and more are killed by legislators who claim to support them.

And voters have no easy way to know what happened or who killed the bills, or why.

Problems include:

- Most votes aren’t recorded
- Information isn’t easy to find online.
- Most bills are killed in committee by being “sent to study”
- No reason is given why a bill is killed
- Votes on important bills are often delayed for 15 months after a bill is filed
- But then Reps aren’t given enough time to read what they’re voting on.

Act on Mass will break down what’s happening in clear, easy-to-understand terms and give you the information you need to engage with state government.
