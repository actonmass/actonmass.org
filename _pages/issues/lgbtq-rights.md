## Our challenge

### Even in blue Massachusetts, we are failing our LGBTQ youth


In Massachusetts...

-   Nearly half of young people who self-identify as LGB have contemplated suicide
-   LGB youth are 3-5x more likely than heterosexual youth to have severe symptoms of depression, including depression and suicide attempts
-   13.4% of LGB youth did not attend school due to safety concerns and bullying
-   2/3 of the LGBTQ victims of hate-based homicides were transgender [1]

## Our choice

### The Healthy Youth Act - Equip young people with LGBTQ-inclusive sex-ed


It requires sex-ed taught in public schools be:

- grounded in fact and science
- teach about consent and healthy relationships
- and be LGBTQ affirming [2]

And it works! **LGBTQ-inclusive curricula led to lower rates of bullying in California schools**. [3]

**91% of Massachusetts voters agree** we should teach sex-ed [4] yet the bill has been killed by the House for 8 years despite the Senate overwhelmingly voting in favor of the bill.
