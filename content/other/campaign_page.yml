  - title: The People's House Campaign
    main_text: The MA State House is broken, and we need your help to fix it.
    first_main_paragraph: The Massachusetts State House is one of the least
      transparent in the country. From backroom deals, to private votes, and an
      ever-increasing concentration of power, our democracy is in crisis. Bay
      Staters deserve a government that centers their voices - not one that
      bends over backwards to keep them out.
    second_main_paragraph: Together, we can make the State House the People’s House. Will you join us?

campaign_problem_and_solution:
  - second_solution: "Step two: Provide every District Team of constituents the
      skills and resources they need to effectively lobby their legislators to
      support these pro-democracy state house reforms."
    third_problem: Instead, our government, time and time again, prioritizes the
      agendas of corporate lobbyists and special interests.
    first_solution: "Step one: Organize thousands of everyday people across the
      commonwealth to demand their legislator support pro-democracy amendments
      to the House and Joint Rules."
    problem_href: https://actonmass.org/transparency/
    solution_main_text: Build grassroots power to fix the broken Rules
    first_problem: Year after year, widely popular legislation that would improve
      the lives of millions is delayed in the State House, made less ambitious,
      or killed behind closed doors.
    third_solution: "Step three: Escalate pressure alongside the District Teams to
      ensure this issue is one that the state house leadership can’t ignore.
      After all, our democracy is on the line."
    solution_title: Our Solution
    problem_main_text: A legislature that de-centers and devalues constituent voices
    second_problem: With the least competitive elections in the country, an immense
      concentration of power into the hands of legislative leadership, and one
      of the least transparent state houses in the country, Beacon Hill has
      become unaccountable to the people

campaign_priority_message:
  - priority_title: "Our 2023 priority: Public Committee Votes"
    priority_first_main_paragraph: The Legislature starts every new session by
      writing their own rulebook. Every two years the legislature adopts
      anti-transparent rules that deliberately exclude the public from
      participating in the lawmaking process. Namely, the House and Joint rules
      do not require that votes taken in legislative committees be made public.
      This is disastrous for democracy; how can we hold our legislators
      accountable when we can't see how they're voting?
    priority_second_main_paragraph: Read more about why making public committee votes is so crucial.
    priority_fourth_main_paragraph: That's where you come in.
    priority_third_main_paragraph: "Our aim is the adoption of an amendment to make
      all committee votes public. This is an exceptionally popular piece of
      legislation: since 2020, our non-binding ballot question for public
      committee votes received an average of 87% approval among the electorate.
      Despite an overwhelming mandate for public committee votes, the
      legislature has, until now, refused to show us how they vote."

  - transparency_title: Become a Transparency Captain!
    transparency_main_text: Our strategy is to organize across the Commonwealth to
      hold as many grassroots lobby meetings with legislators as possible, but
      we can’t do it alone; we need leaders in every corner of the state to take
      point on organizing the campaign in their hometown. Transparency Captains
      work closely with Act on Mass staff to lead and grow the campaign team in
      their district. This is a low-commitment high reward leadership role for
      anyone looking to make a big difference for democracy in their own
      backyard. The next Rules vote will likely be in January of 2025, and we
      intend to use every second of the next two years to build our movement.

  - letter_title: Write a Letter to the Editor!
    letter_main_text: Writing an op-ed or a letter to the editor in your local paper
      is a powerful way to spread the word and let your community know about why
      you’re committed to fighting for transparency. It’s also a great way to
      let your Rep know what’s important to you, since reps and their staffers
      keep track of what’s going on in the district through local media!
