    main_text: The MA State House is broken, and we need your help to fix it.
    first_main_paragraph: The Massachusetts State House is one of the least
      transparent in the country. When decisions about what bills will pass are
      made in backroom deals with a small handful of people, that’s not
      democracy. Bay Staters deserve a government that centers their voices -
      not one that bends over backwards to keep them out.
    second_main_paragraph: Together, we can make the State House the People’s House. Will you join us?

campaign_priority_message:
  - priority_title: "Our 2023 priority: Public Committee Votes"
    priority_first_main_paragraph: The Legislature starts every new session by
      writing their own rulebook. Every two years the legislature adopts
      anti-transparent rules that deliberately exclude the public from
      participating in the lawmaking process. Namely, the House and Joint rules
      do not require that votes taken in legislative committees be made public.
      This is disastrous for democracy--how can we hold our legislators
      accountable when we can't see how they're voting?
    priority_second_main_paragraph: Read more about why making public committee votes is so crucial.
    priority_fourth_main_paragraph: That's where you come in.
    priority_third_main_paragraph: 'Our aim is the adoption of an amendment to make
      all committee votes public. This is an exceptionally popular piece of
      legislation: since 2020, our non-binding ballot question for
      public committee votes received an average of 87% approval among the
      electorate. Despite an overwhelming mandate for
      public committee votes, the legislature has, until now, refused to show us
      how they vote.'
