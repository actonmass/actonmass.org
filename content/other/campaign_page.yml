    main_text: The MA State House is broken, and we need your help to fix it.
    first_main_paragraph: The Massachusetts State House is one of the least
      transparent in the country. When decisions about what bills will pass are
      made in backroom deals with a small handful of people, that’s not
      democracy. Bay Staters deserve a government that centers their voices -
      not one that bends over backwards to keep them out.
    second_main_paragraph: Together, we can make the State House the People’s House. Will you join us?
