full_title: An Act relative to the open meeting law
twitter_bill_name: Open Meeting Law
house_no: H.3121

committee: joint-state-administration-and-regulatory-oversight

summary:
  - Under existing OML provisions, the public is permitted to attend meetings of
    public bodies besides the Legislature, namely all 351 municipal governments.
  - This bill would extend that democratic privilege to constituents wishing to
    monitor legislative proceedings of the State House.
text: Open Meeting Law (OML) is a policy already in place for the vast majority
  of governing bodies in the state. OML promotes transparency across a number of
  state-level meetings and to include the general public in the decision-making
  processes, the legislature has historically exempted itself from OML.

    I am calling today in support of An Act relative to the open meeting law,
    H.3121. I ask that you sign onto this bill as a cosponsor and promote its
    swift passage through the rest of the legislative process.




    Open Meeting Law (“OML”) requires that meetings of a public body be open to the public, notice of meetings given in advance, and records of past meetings made available. By opening up the inner workings of government to the people, OML is a cornerstone of any democracy. Not only does the public have the right to observe the deliberations of policy that will shape their lives, we make better policy when everyday people are able to understand and participate more actively in their government. 




    Here in Massachusetts all 351 cities and towns are held to the standards of OML, and rightfully so; Bay Staters can attend their school board or city council meetings to observe how the governing bodies they elected are (or are not) fulfilling their duties and promises, and to understand why these decisions are being made in the first place. The Legislature, the most powerful deliberative body in the state, is not held to this standard. In fact, Massachusetts is one of only 11 states where the Legislature is exempt from OML. 




    At a time when the public’s faith in government is low, and some of the most critical policy challenges of our lifetime are on the horizon, subjecting the Legislature to basic transparency and accountability such as OML so that all voices can be heard and represented has never been more important. 




    For these reasons, I ask for your cosponsorship on this bill. Thank you for your time and consideration.
