summary:
  - Under existing OML provisions, the public is permitted to attend meetings of
    public bodies besides the Legislature, namely all 351 municipal governments.
  - This bill would extend that democratic privilege to constituents wishing to
    monitor legislative proceedings of the State House.
text: Open Meeting Law (OML) is a policy already in place for the vast majority
  of governing bodies in the state. OML promotes transparency across a number of
  state-level meetings and to include the general public in the decision-making
  processes, the legislature has historically exempted itself from OML.
