  Since the early twentieth century, Native American mascots, logos, and symbols
  have reinforced stereotypes against Indigenous people in the United States.
  The National Congress of American Indians
  [(NCAI)](http://maindigenousagenda.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NCAI-Letter-to-MA-State-Legislature-on-Mascot-Bill-7-22-20.pdf)
  has fought to end harmful representation of Indigenous culture for over 50
  years. 


  Over [40 High Schools](https://www.masslive.com/news/2017/02/these_massachusetts_schools_st.html) in Massachusetts continue to appropriate Indigenous culture through the use of racist mascots. “We don’t feel like we are being honored by any mascots. We feel like a trophy,” Brittney Walley, a member of the Nipmuc Nation, said in a [recent speech](https://www.wcvb.com/article/new-push-to-ban-native-american-mascots-at-massachusetts-schools/33332657) in support of the mascot ban. Native American mascots are known to be socially and emotionally [damaging](http://maindigenousagenda.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Massachusett-Mascot-letter.pdf) to indigenous youth, who have a suicide rate three times higher than their peers. In addition to lowering self esteem of Indigenous students, these stereotypical depictions of Native Americans reinforce racist beliefs and attitudes in their non-Native peers. 


  In order to provide a safe environment where Indigenous students can thrive, Massachusetts must end the practice of Native American logos and mascots.
