summary:
  - Replaces Columbus Day with Indigenous People's Day in Massachusetts Law
text: >-
  This bill replaces Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day in the
  Massachusetts General Laws. Changing the 2nd Monday in October to Indigenous
  People’s Day acknowledges the harmful impact of celebrating Columbus as a
  hero. Historical accounts prove that wherever they went, Columbus and his men
  murdered and enslaved Indigenous People. The repercussions continue to be
  keenly felt even now. Indigenous Peoples Day replaces something negative with
  something positive – an increased awareness of Indigenous Peoples and a
  celebration of Indigenous resilience and survival, in MA as well as throughout
  the Americas. To learn more, you can watch a recording of the [Indigenous
