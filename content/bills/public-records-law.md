    I am calling today to share my support of S. 2064: An Act extending the
    public records law to the Governor and the Legislature. I ask that you sign
    on to this bill as a cosponsor and promote its swift passage through the
    rest of the legislative process.




    Public Records Law (“PRL”) guarantees the public’s access to the various records generated by their government. From agendas and emails to memoranda and receipts, the public has a right to monitor, observe, and understand how the public’s business is being conducted on their behalf, and with their tax dollars. This core tenet of democracy is critical in order to foster trust between government officials and the people they serve. This is why I strongly believe that the Legislature and the Governor’s Office ought to be subject to the rigor of PRL. 




    Massachusetts is consistently ranked among the least transparent state governments in the country. In 2015, the Center for Public Integrity gave Massachusetts a [failing grade](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/state-politics/state-integrity-investigation/massachusetts-gets-d-grade-in-2015-state-integrity-investigation/) in the category of “Public Access to Information” largely due to the Legislature’s self-exemption to PRL. In fact, Massachusetts is one of just [four states](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2018/oct/16/legislative-exemptions-overview/) in which the Legislature is exempt from PRL, and is the only state in the country where the Legislature, Judiciary, and Governor’s Office all claim exemption. It’s time to change that.




    Not only does this exception thwart constituents and advocates trying to understand the lawmaking process that affects their lives, it also stifles the power of the press to act as a check on governmental power. 




    For these reasons, I ask you to cosponsor this bill. Thank you for your time and consideration.
