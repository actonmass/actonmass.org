summary:
  - Allows candidates for office to pay for necessary child care expenses from
    campaign funds
  - Catches MA up to states like Texas, Alabama, and Wisconsin
text: Currently, childcare costs incurred during campaign events and activities
  are considered personal expenses and therefore not eligible for reimbursement
  under MA law. This bill would allow state and local candidates to use their
  campaign funds to pay for campaign-related childcare expenses. Childcare
  should be treated like other allowable expenses, such as printing literature
  and purchasing tuxedos for campaign events. This bill would eliminate a major
  barrier for parents seeking public office in their communities and advance
  equitable political representation throughout the Commonwealth.
