summary:
  - Establishes a Commission to develop anti-racist and social justice-focused
    curriculum for Massachusetts schools
  - The Commission would also advise the Department of Elementary and Secondary
    Education on how to increase, support, and retain educators and counselors
    of color

  public schools in many ways, including the curriculum itself. History and
  social studies taught in our schools often exclude ethnic studies, center the
  history and narratives of white people, and uphold colonial frameworks.
