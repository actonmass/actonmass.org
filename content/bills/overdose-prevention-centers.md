summary:
  - Several communities across the state are interested in opening overdose
    prevention sites, including Somerville and other cities, but legislation is
    needed to establish the legal and regulatory framework for them to operate
    successfully.
  - Municipalities need to know the state will not stand in the way of local,
    evidence-based public health efforts. Providers need to know working at a
    center will not jeopardize their professional license. Clients need to know
    they will not face legal consequences for utilizing a site.
  - This bill establishes a 10 year pilot program of overdose prevention centers
    that require approval by local boards of health
text: >-
  Overdose prevention centers, sometimes called safe consumption sites, are
  evidence-\

  based, legally sanctioned harm reduction facilities where people who use drugs can\

  safely consume pre-obtained drugs under supervision of trained healthcare workers. In\

  addition to preventing lethal overdoses, such facilities are designed to reduce the\

  transmission of infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis, and connect patients with\

  social services, including drug treatment and recovery services.


  Leading medical and public health advocacy stakeholder groups strongly support the\

  piloting of OPCs including the Massachusetts Medical Society and Massachusetts Public\

  Health Association, major Massachusetts hospitals and providers such as Boston Medical\

  Center, Mass General Brigham and Fenway Health, and non-profits RIZE Massachusetts\

  Foundation and the Massachusetts Organization for Addiction Recovery (MOAR).
