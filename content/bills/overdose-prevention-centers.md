text: >-
  Overdose prevention centers, sometimes called safe consumption sites, are
  evidence- based, legally sanctioned harm reduction facilities where people who
  use drugs can safely consume pre-obtained drugs under supervision of trained
  healthcare workers. In addition to preventing lethal overdoses, such
  facilities are designed to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases like
  HIV and hepatitis, and connect patients with social services, including drug
  treatment and recovery services.


  Leading medical and public health advocacy stakeholder groups strongly support the piloting of OPCs including the Massachusetts Medical Society and Massachusetts Public Health Association, major Massachusetts hospitals and providers such as Boston Medical Center, Mass General Brigham and Fenway Health, and nonprofits RIZE Massachusetts Foundation and the Massachusetts Organization for Addiction Recovery (MOAR).
