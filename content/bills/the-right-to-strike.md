summary:
  - Abolishes the prohibition on certain public employees striking, namely
    teachers
text: >-
  Massachusetts public employees, including educators, are currently prohibited
  by state law from engaging in a strike, regardless of their working
  conditions, their studentsâ€™ learning conditions, or whether their employer may
  have committed unfair labor practices. This outright ban on public employees
  striking is deeply unjust, prevents educators from bargaining on a level
  playing field with their employers, and unfairly restricts the ability of
  educators to take collective action in support of themselves and their
  families, their students and\

  the communities they serve.


  An Act uplifting families and securing the right to strike for certain public employees would\

  address this injustice by:


  * Allowing educators and other public employees, except for public safety personnel, to legally strike after six months of failed negotiations with their employer.

  * Ensuring that the right to free speech is no longer restricted for public employees and their unions as it relates to discussing or supporting a strike.
