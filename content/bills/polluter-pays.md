summary:
  - Fossil fuel companies have knowingly endangered us all for decades and put
    our lives and livelihoods at risk–they should be responsible for the
    damages. Holding polluters responsible for the damage they have caused is
    wildly popular across the political spectrum; 77% of Americans support
    holding big oil and gas companies accountable.
  - By a 40-point margin, likely voters support a $500 billion fee on major
    fossil fuel companies to compensate for their contributions to climate
    change.
  - The bill will generate $75 billion over 25 years from the profits of the
    biggest greenhouse gas emitters. The Superfund will support climate change
    adaptation projects statewide, with 40% of the funding directly benefiting
    environmental justice communities.
text: "“An Act establishing a climate change superfund and promoting polluter
  responsibility” (shorthand: “Make Polluters Pay” or “Polluter Responsibility
  Superfund”) is a new bill in the MA legislature sponsored by Sen Eldridge and
  Rep Owens that would require top polluters to contribute to a superfund used
  to pay for climate-related damages in Massachusetts. 77% of Americans support
  holding oil and gas companies accountable for climate related damages.
  Massachusetts follows Maryland and New York in submitting statewide
  legislation to hold companies accountable to the polluters pay principle. This
  legislation would allow Massachusetts to properly prepare for the inevitable
  impacts of climate change due to locked-in warming. This bill is designed to
  hold those responsible for the increase in extreme weather events accountable
  and fund cities and towns efforts to protect their residents."
