summary:
  - Establishes a single-payer health care system in Massachusetts
  - Provides health care for all Massachusetts residents and individuals who
    work more than 20 hours per week in the state without premiums, co-pays, or
    deductibles
  - Bans private insurance coverage for services already covered by the
    single-payer system
text: >-
  Massachusetts spends more on healthcare than nearly every state in the nation.
  Under Medicare for All,\

  money currently spent on profits, marketing, and administration would go to actual healthcare, and also\

  provide $34 billion of savings in the first year alone.


  * Employers and employees would no longer pay private companies for health care coverage\
    Instead, employees would pay a 2.5% tax,\
    excluding the first $20,000 of earnings;\
    employers would pay an 8% payroll tax\
    • Children, students, the unemployed, and\
    retirees would not be taxed\
    • The bottom 90% of Massachusetts residents\
    would save compared to what they spend now;\
    only the top 10% would pay more\
    What’s covered under Medicare for All?\
    • All healthcare services would be covered,\
    including hospital care, outpatient care,\
    reproductive care including abortion, dental,\
    and long-term care – from cradle to grave\
    • No premiums, co-pays, or out-of-pocket costs\
    • Every Massachusetts resident would be\
    enrolled - regardless of employment,\
    citizenship status, age, or income
