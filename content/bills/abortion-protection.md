  The [ROE Act](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/SD109) codifies the right to
  abortion into state law, ensuring it will remain legal in Massachusetts. But
  with the U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade*,
  Massachusetts must be prepared to handle the cascading impacts of hostile
  abortion bans across the nation, go further to remove barriers to abortion
  that still exist in our state, and ensure meaningful access for anyone who
  wants it.


  While abortion is legal in Massachusetts, it is not without restriction. This bill would further remove medically unnecessary barriers to abortion that often delay and/or stigmatize abortion care including several TRAP policies like unnecessary waiting periods for health-related information, ultrasounds inconsistent with the standard of care and review, and medically unnecessary regulations on facilities. It would also require the Department of Public Health to publicize information on where residents can find legitimate reproductive health care providers and invest in public education efforts to combat mis- and dis-information from anti-abortion organizations targeting pregnant people.
