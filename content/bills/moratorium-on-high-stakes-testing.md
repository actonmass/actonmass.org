summary:
  - Establishes a moratorium on standardized testing being a requirement for
    high school graduation
  - Creates a grant program for school districts to establish task forces to
    develop alternative assessment models
text: Standardized testing might sound like a good idea on the surface. But
  testing shows a racial bias and advantages students from wealthier
  backgrounds. And the results of these tests are used by privatizers who hope
  to convert our public education system into a private one.
