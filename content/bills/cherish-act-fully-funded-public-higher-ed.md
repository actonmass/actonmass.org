summary:
  - Allocates $600M new funding for our public higher education system
  - Establishes a fair minimum funding level per student to ensure funding keeps
    pace with enrollments
  - Freezes tuition and fees for five years to ensure higher ed is in reach of
    all students who want to attend
text: "Most Americans, when polled, think that Higher education is receiving the
  same or more funding than it did in the past.  But per pupil funding from the
  state is down 31% since 2001, and this is forcing public institutions to delay
  repairs, try to cut costs, and push higher tuition and fees on students who
  can ill afford them.


  The Commission on Public Higher Education Finance issued a report in 2014
  outlining this chronic underfunding, but our legislature hasn't taken major
  action. Every year, tiny increases in the state budget barely keep up for
  inflation, meanwhile students and educators pay the costs."
