summary:
  - Gradually raise the upper age for delinquency and youth offender cases to
    include 18-20 year olds, ensuring that they are not charged as adults
  - Ensure that young people who are incarcerated are able to participate in
    impactful rehabilitative programs that are not available in the adult
    correctional system
text: In Massachusetts, the civil age of majority is 18 years of age, this means
  that any individuals who are 18 years of age and older are treated as adults
  in the criminal justice system. Raising the age of criminal majority to 21
  years of age would recognize the potential for measures that would help
  support the individuals which would establish educational and rehabilitative
  measures rather than punitive ones. This would begin to tackle mass
  incarceration in the state and dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline.
  According to Citizens for Juvenile Justice (CFJJ), Black teenage boys in
  America are 12.4 times more likely to be incarcerated in adult corrections
  than those who are white. This exacerbates racial and economic disparities in
  our communities by systematically stripping young Black boys of educational
  and economic opportunities. The legislature has the power to enact an act to
  Promote Public Safety and Better Outcomes for Young Adults which would ensure
  that young people who are incarcerated can participate in rehabilitation and
  educational programs that arenâ€™t accessible in the adult correctional system.
