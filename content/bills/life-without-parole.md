summary:
  - Ends mandatory minimum sentencing that forces life without parole for
    certain crimes
  - Reduces the incarcerated population, freeing up funding that is desperately
    needed for essential public services like hospitals and schools
  - Is the first step to reorienting our criminal justice system away from
    punishment and toward rehabilitation
