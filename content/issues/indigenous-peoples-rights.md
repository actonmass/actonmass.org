catchphrase: The 50,000 Native Americans in Massachusetts deserve opportunity,
  civil rights, and self-determination.
text: Massachusetts has a long history of disregarding the rights and concerns
  of its Indigenous population since the state’s colonization. One of the many
  long-standing issues the Indigenous people have faced is their ability to keep
  the land that is rightfully theirs. Along with the protection and preservation
  of their cultures, sacred languages, and heritage sites by the government. The
  Indigenous people have been underfunded and overlooked by the government for
  an extensive time, which has contributed to unequal educational opportunities,
  healthcare disparities, and environmental concerns. The Legislature has the
  power to enact an Act to protect Native American heritage and an act to
  establish Indigenous People’s Day in Massachusetts Law, two major steps in
  Massachusetts that would contribute to the conservation of Indigenous culture.

  - title: Racist Mascots
    text: There are 25 - 30 schools in Massachusetts that currently use Native
      American mascots. These mascots reinforce racist and dehumanizing
      stereotypes. Exposure to such mascots has been
      [shown](http://gonetowar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mascot-Effects.pdf)
      to have negative psychological impacts on Native students, including
      lowered self-esteem and lowered ambition.
  - title: Close the Opportunity Gap
    text: Over 50% of Native high school students enrolled in the Boston Public
      School system do not graduate with their class, and 27% ultimately drop
      out. This is much higher than the rates for BPS students generally - 41%
      and 20%, respectively. Massachusetts schools are already woefully
      underfunded, and Native students face numerous additional barriers to
      academic success and opportunities that are not being addressed through
      legislation.
  - title: Indigenous Peoples Day
    text: Indigenous Peoples Day is a holiday that is recognized by many, yet
      Massachusetts general law still fails to acknowledge the holiday in
      replacement of Columbus. The importance of establishing this holiday would
      not only positively impact the acknowledgment of cultures, languages, and
      history of the Indigenous people but also would acknowledge and replace
      the holiday honoring a genocidal colonizer.
