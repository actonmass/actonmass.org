catchphrase: The 50,000 Native Americans in Massachusetts deserve opportunity,
  civil rights, and self-determination.
text: Massachusetts has a long history of disregarding the rights and concerns
  of its Indigenous population since the state’s colonization. One of the many
  long-standing issues the Indigenous people have faced is their ability to keep
  the land that is rightfully theirs. Along with the protection and preservation
  of their cultures, sacred languages, and heritage sites by the government. The
  Indigenous people have been underfunded and overlooked by the government for
  an extensive time, which has contributed to unequal educational opportunities,
  healthcare disparities, and environmental concerns. The Legislature has the
  power to enact an Act to protect Native American heritage and an act to
  establish Indigenous People’s Day in Massachusetts Law, two major steps in
  Massachusetts that would contribute to the conservation of Indigenous culture.

  - title: Racist Mascots
    text: There are 25 - 30 schools in Massachusetts that currently use Native
      American mascots. These mascots reinforce racist and dehumanizing
      stereotypes. Exposure to such mascots has been
      [shown](http://gonetowar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mascot-Effects.pdf)
      to have negative psychological impacts on Native students, including
      lowered self-esteem and lowered ambition.
  - title: Close the Opportunity Gap
    text: Over 50% of Native high school students enrolled in the Boston Public
      School system do not graduate with their class, and 27% ultimately drop
      out. This is much higher than the rates for BPS students generally - 41%
      and 20%, respectively. Massachusetts schools are already woefully
      underfunded, and Native students face numerous additional barriers to
      academic success and opportunities that are not being addressed through
      legislation.
  - title: Indigenous Peoples Day
    text: Indigenous Peoples Day is a holiday that is recognized by many, yet
      Massachusetts general law still fails to acknowledge the holiday in
      replacement of Columbus. The importance of establishing this holiday would
      not only positively impact the acknowledgment of cultures, languages, and
      history of the Indigenous people but also would acknowledge and replace
      the holiday honoring a genocidal colonizer.
questions:
  - title: "Why should mascots change if they are perceived to be honoring native
      heritage? "
    text: Mascots that depict and symbolize Native figures and heritage do not honor
      the culture of Indigenous peoples but rather objectify and dehumanize
      them. Native American mascots often reduce the rich and diverse cultures
      of Indigenous peoples to inaccurate and degrading caricatures that
      perpetuate harmful stereotypes. In addition to being culturally
      insensitive, they often don't seek approval or input from Indigenous
      communities contributing to a lack of accurate representation in these
      cultures.
  - title: Why do we need to get rid of Columbus Day? Why can’t we have both holidays?
    text: >-
      Indigenous Peoples Day is about more than a name change; it’s a refusal to
      allow the genocide of millions of Indigenous peoples to go unnoticed, and
      a demand for recognition of Indigenous humanity. Recognizing this day in
      place of what’s currently known as “Columbus Day” is a way to correct
      false histories, honor Indigenous peoples, and begin to correct some of
      the countless wrongs committed against Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island
      (what’s now known as the Americas).


      Words have meanings; words control who and what we think about, and this has implications on our actions. If we continue to erase Indigenous peoples, and celebrate a colonizer (Christopher Columbus) instead, that will have a direct impact on the ways Indigenous peoples are treated. If we can’t even so much as celebrate the first peoples of this land, and not the person responsible for the largest genocide ever committed, then how can we expect good public policy or day to day treatment for Native Americans?

  - title: Why does this matter in Massachusetts?
    text: >-
      All of what we know today as Massachusetts is built upon land stolen from
      Indigenous people.

  - title: Doesn’t my town already recognize Indigenous People’s Day?
    text: >-
      In light of inaction at the state and federal levels, some towns and
      cities in MA have already passed their own local ordinances to formally
      recognize the second Monday of October as Indigenous People’s Day.


      Towns that have adopted Indigenous Peoples Day: Amherst, Aquinnah, Arlington, Bedford, Belmont, Boston,  Brookline, Cambridge, Easthampton, Falmouth, Grafton, Great Barrington, Harvard, Holyoke, Marblehead, Mashpee, Maynard, Melrose, Newton, Northampton, Provincetown, Salem, Somerville, Stow, and Wellesley
  - title: Terminology
    text: >-
      The terminology used to describe American Indian people has changed over
      the years, as have the people that are recognized by state and federal
      governments as being American Indian. The terms that are often used today
      include American Indian, Native American, Indigenous, Indian, First
      Peoples, Aboriginal, and First Nations. Typically, First Nations is used
      to describe American Indian people in Canada and Aboriginal is used to
      describe the Native people of Australia. The Native people of Alaska have
      been recognized as Alaska Native by the federal government since 1971.
      Native Hawaiians, are the most recent Native population to be included in
      federal programs made available to American Indians although they are not
      federally recognized as a tribe. On this website, you will find the
      various terms that describe Indigenous peoples used interchangeably or
      used together. We do this to respect the terminology that different tribes
      and people use to describe themselves.


      We honor Indigenous people who may or may not be part of a federally recognized or state recognized tribe, as well as the peoples whose tribes have been split by the U.S.-Canada border and the U.S.-Mexico border. All Indigenous people are welcome at the North American Indian Center of Boston.
