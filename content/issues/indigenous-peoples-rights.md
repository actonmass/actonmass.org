  - title: Racist Mascots
    text: There are 25 - 30 schools in Massachusetts that currently use Native
      American mascots. These mascots reinforce racist and dehumanizing
      stereotypes. Exposure to such mascots has been
      [shown](http://gonetowar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mascot-Effects.pdf)
      to have negative psychological impacts on Native students, including
      lowered self-esteem and lowered ambition.
  - title: Close the Opportunity Gap
    text: Over half of Native high students enrolled in the Boston Public School
      system do not graduate with their class, and 27% end up dropping out. This
      is much higher than the rates for BPS students generally, which are 41%
      and 20%, respectively. Massachusetts schools are already woefully
      underfunded, and Native students face numerous additional barriers to
      academic success and opportunities that are not being addressed through
      legislation.
