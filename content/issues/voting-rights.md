catchphrase: "Crucial voting reforms that have succeeded elsewhere in making the
  political process more open and democratic, such as ranked choice voting and
  same-day voter registration, have been held up by the Legislature for years.
  Here's where we're at now:"
highlighted_bills:
  - ranked-choice-voting
  - same-day-voter-registration
failures_block_title: Massachusetts refuses to pass commonsense voter reforms
  that would make the right to vote accessible for every eligible voter in the
  state.
failures:
  - title: Same Day Voter Registration
    text: Same-day voter registration has proven to increase voter turnout,
      especially among young voters and underrepresented groups. In a state like
      Massachusetts with a high percentage of transient voters who move
      frequently and young voters, this should be an obvious reform. However,
      the bill has been introduced session after session with no resolution, and
      in its latest form has had its reporting date extended to effectively the
      end of session. Same-day registration works, and the Legislature can't
      continue to keep pushing it off like this.
  - title: Universal Mail-in Voting
    text: Even though we've seen this year that mail-in voting increases turnout
      especially among lower-income voters, young voters, and newly registered
      voters, the Legislature still hasn't acted to make sure no-excuse
      universal mail-in voting is the standard after the pandemic.
questions:
  - title: Do ballots using ranked choice voting have more errors than traditional
      ballots?
    text: "**No.** Every election, whether it uses ranked choice voting or the
      traditional First Past the Post system, has the potential for error. But
      ballot errors are highest in traditional even-year partisan primaries, in
      which voters mistakenly vote for candidates from more than one party.
      Other states that have paired ranked choice voting reforms with widespread
      voter education to inform the public about the changes have reported less
      errors on average."
  - title: Does ranked choice voting favor incumbents and the wealthy at the expense
      of diverse candidates?
    text: "**No.** Ranked choice voting allows candidates to run without fear of
      being automatically eliminated in a low-turnout primary, as well as the
      opportunity to garner votes from voters who are no longer afraid of
      splitting or wasting their vote. This benefits candidates who may have
      similar platforms or appeal as other candidates on the ballot, but
      eliminates the risk that a voter would waste their vote by choosing their
      preferred candidate. In this sense, candidates with less of a fundraising
      advantage or who lack name recognition are still able to mobilize their
      bases to vote for them, disproportionately benefiting working class
      candidates and candidates of color."
