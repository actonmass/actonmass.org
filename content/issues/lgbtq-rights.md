  - title: Conversion Therapy
    text: Massachusetts didn't pass a statewide ban on conversion therapy for minors
      until 2019, despite its proven harmful effects on LGBTQ+ youth, and a
      supermajority of legislators in support.
  - title: Sex Education
    text: Comprehensive, gender-affirming sex education is still not available to
      all K-12 public school students in the Commonwealth
  - title: Mental Health
    text: >-
      LGBTQ youth report alarmingly high levels of depression, anxiety,
      suicidality, and trauma, yet most who wanted mental healthcare did not
      receive it. According to [analysis of the 2021 Massachusetts Youth Risk
      Behavior
      Survey](https://www.mass.gov/doc/mclgbtqy-annual-recommendations-fy-2024-0/download)
      (MYRBS), LGBTQ youth in our state endure significant discrepancies in
      mental health support.   


      * LGBTQ youth are about **three times more likely to skip school** in the last 30 days because they felt they would be unsafe at school or on their way to or from school

      * LGBTQ youth are about **twice as likely to be bullied in school**:8.7% of cis-het youth and 18.7% of LGBTQ youth reported being bullied. The gap widens when accounting for electronic bullying, which 25.9% of LGBTQ youth report experiencing, compared to 10.4% of cis-het youth 

      * LGBTQ youth are about **three times more likely to report self-harm**, with 49.5% of LGBTQ youth, and 11.3% of cis-het youth reporting hurting themselves

      * LGBTQ youth are nearly **four times more likely to consider or attempt suicide**.


      This data demonstrates a mental health crisis among LGBTQ youth that the Commonwealth has yet to act upon.

title: LGBTQ+ Rights
subtitle: LGBTQ+ inclusive, gender-affirming sex education
page_img: /img/mercedes-mehling-7j7x8hlxqka-unsplash.jpg
catchphrase: MA was the first state to recognize same-sex marriage, but only
  because of a court ruling. Our legislature is still moving too slowly on civil
  rights issues
text: Massachusetts General Law Chapter 76 section 5 explicitly states “No
  person shall be excluded from or discriminated against in admission to a
  public school of any town, or in obtaining the advantages, privileges and
  courses of study of such public school on account of race, color, sex, gender
  identity, religion, national origin or sexual orientation.” Yet, even within
  this state, we must acknowledge that there is an rise of anti-LGBTQ activity
  of people targeting the civil rights of children, youth, and families,
  including proposed book bans, protests at drag story hours, and bomb threats
  against Boston Children's Hospital for providing gender-affirming care. By
  ignoring these attacks, legislators are sending a poignant message to our
  youth that – while those in power know of their suffering – there is little
  care and attention to the necessary work to protect the health, safety, and
  well-being of queer youth in this state.

questions:
  - title: Is sex education really a necessary part of a comprehensive public school
      education?
    text: "**Yes.** Learning about consent, about the reproductive system, and about
      contraception and healthy practices is a crucial part of development for
      young adults, and for LGBTQ+ teens it's essential that gender-affirming
      care and education begins in public schools. Comprehensive sex education
      based on science and research has shown to lower STD rates among young
      people, reduced risks of unwanted pregnancy, and reduced rates
      nonconsensual sex and sexual assault."
  - title: "Is comprehensive sex education popular? "
    text: "**Yes.** An overwhelming majority of likely Massachusetts voters want sex
      education to be taught in schools and believe this education should cover
      a range of topics about safer sex and healthy relationships, [according to
      a 2018
      study](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/uploads/filer_public/6d/d3\
      /6dd3bdd9-8a72-4395-97e9-8278116a84b3/polling_memo_sex_ed_july_2018.pdf)
      by EMC Research. Overall, 76 percent of likely Massachusetts voters
      believe middle school students have a right to receive sex education. This
      support jumps even higher—to 91 percent—when respondents were asked about
      high school students’ right to sex education. Not only do likely
      Massachusetts voters support school-based sex education, they strongly
      agree that sex education curricula should include a comprehensive range of
      topics. A total of 93 percent of likely Massachusetts voters believe sex
      education should teach young people how to care for their sexual health,
      as well as how to build healthy, respectful relationships and understand
      consent. This support is strong among voters of all political parties and
      in every region of the state."
