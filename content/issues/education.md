  - title: Public K-12 Education
    text: Since 1993, MA hasn't been spending enough money on public K-12 education,
      and finally after decades of delay, the legislature passed a $1.5B school
      funding bill. However, we've already seen the initial funding timeline
      delayed
  - title: Public Higher Education
    text: Our public higher education system is out of reach for many. Lack of
      appropriate funding to the UMass system has resulted in tuition and fee
      hikes. Spending per pupil is **down 31% in the last two decades**. We must
      pass the Cherish Act to get funding levels back up.
  - title: Cancel MCAS
    text: Standardized testing is a favorite tool of privatizers who want to use
      poor test scores against school districts rather than funding them
      appropriately. We won a victory in 2020 with the cancellation of all MCAS
      requirements due to Covid, but now we need to make that permanent.

catchphrase: We must equitably fund our public schools so that a child's zip
  code doesn't determine their right to a great public education.
text: Problems within the Massachusetts education system are continuously
  harming children’s ability to learn. There are mass disparities in the
  educational outcomes of different socioeconomic groups throughout the state,
  as students in low-income areas don’t have access to the high-quality
  education other districts are receiving. The Massachusetts Standardized
  Testing System better known as the ‘MCAS’ is a form of inadequate testing that
  doesn’t account for the disparities and educational inequities communities
  face. Communities that are facing these inequities are receiving significantly
  less funding than those that hold higher socioeconomic status and higher MCAS
  score averages. The Legislature has the power to make investments in public
  pre-K-12 and higher education through the Cherish Act and has the authority to
  end the high-stakes testing regime through the Thrive Act.

questions:
  - title: Don't we already spend a lot of money on public education?
    text: >
      Public school funding comes primarily from two places: the state, and the
      city/town school district. The state consistently underfunds all public
      schools, but wealthier cities and towns use their own funds to make up the
      difference between the “foundation budget” and the actual cost of giving
      students a quality education. This practice perpetuates inequalities, as
      wealthier districts can afford to put extra money into their schools,
      while schools in poorer districts are severely underfunded. The state’s
      wealthiest school districts spend over 40% more per student than the
      state’s poorest school districts.

  - title: Can’t public schools use funding more efficiently?
    text: >
      It is a myth that public schools cannot use funding efficiently. In fact,
      many public schools have been increasing class sizes in an effort to save
      money, and many public school teachers have to buy their own supplies.


      The Foundation Budget Review Commission (“FBRC”) has already researched what a reasonable budget would be for a public school. The FBRC was a bipartisan group; their findings should not have been controversial. The problem is not a lack of research; the problem is a lack of political will on Beacon Hill to fund education.
  - title: Why are Massachusetts PreK-12 schools still facing segregation and
      disparities?
    text: Due to Massachusetts’s long history of deep-rooted racial injustice and
      inequality, the state’s public PreK-12 schools have been facing
      socioeconomic and racial segregation for a very long time. Most commonly
      through socioeconomic disparities, schools in districts that have higher
      property value and taxes receive the highest levels of education funding,
      resources, opportunities, and test scores. While those in lower-income
      communities receive fewer resources to provide quality education and
      continue widening the achievement gap within the state.
  - title: Why should we get rid of the MCAS graduation requirement?
    text: The MCAS graduation requirement is very harmful to students in numerous
      ways. The test is not equitable for all students as those who are in
      underfunded schools and lower-income districts don’t have the same
      resources and preparation opportunities as those in higher-income
      communities and schools. The Massachusetts Teachers Association has long
      supported the elimination of the requirement as they believe that forcing
      students to pass the test reduces educational learning and limits what
      subjects teachers can teach while reducing creativity and producing stress
      within the classroom.
