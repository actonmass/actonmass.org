catchphrase: "Crucial voting reforms that have succeeded elsewhere in making the
  political process more open and democratic, such as ranked choice voting and
  same-day voter registration, have been held up by the Legislature for years.
  Here's where we're at now:"
text: In Massachusetts, the issue of election reform presents serious problems
  that demand immediate attention and effective resolution. Introducing and
  expanding processes such as same-day voter registration and ranked-choice
  voting will continue the fight against voting insecurity and voter suppression
  that are actively harming our democracy. Through these processes, there will
  be a more fair, inclusive, and democratic process which would increase
  participation, representation, and accessibility in voting. The legislature
  has the power to enact two bills that are relative to voting rights
  restoration which would help restore voting rights to incarcerated people
  along with continuing the fight to restore the right to vote for the general
  public.

      Massachusetts doesn't allow parents running for office to pay for
      childcare expenses with campaign funds, shutting out many parents
      especially mothers from running for office.


      * Allows candidates for office to pay for necessary child care expenses from campaign funds

      * Catches MA up to states like Texas, Alabama, and Wisconsin

  - text: Same-day voter registration is important in Massachusetts because it
      allows all eligible voters to register and vote on the same day of the
      election, providing a fair and equal opportunity to the public. In most
      cases, it’s often younger generations, lower-income individuals, and
      people who come from marginalized communities who aren’t given the same
      opportunity to vote as those who are before election day. When same-day
      registration is accessible to the public it increases voter turnout along
      with providing convenience to voters as some may be inclined to register
      to vote more efficiently.
