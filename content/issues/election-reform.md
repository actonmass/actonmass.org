catchphrase: "Crucial voting reforms that have succeeded elsewhere in making the
  political process more open and democratic, such as ranked choice voting and
  same-day voter registration, have been held up by the Legislature for years.
  Here's where we're at now:"
text: In Massachusetts, the issue of election reform presents serious problems
  that demand immediate attention and effective resolution. Introducing and
  expanding processes such as same-day voter registration and ranked-choice
  voting will continue the fight against voting insecurity and voter suppression
  that are actively harming our democracy. Through these processes, there will
  be a more fair, inclusive, and democratic process which would increase
  participation, representation, and accessibility in voting. The legislature
  has the power to enact two bills that are relative to voting rights
  restoration which would help restore voting rights to incarcerated people
  along with continuing the fight to restore the right to vote for the general
  public.

      Massachusetts doesn't allow parents running for office to pay for
      childcare expenses with campaign funds, shutting out many parents
      especially mothers from running for office.


      * Allows candidates for office to pay for necessary child care expenses from campaign funds

      * Catches MA up to states like Texas, Alabama, and Wisconsin
    title: Childcare equity
  - text: Same-day voter registration is important in Massachusetts because it
      allows all eligible voters to register and vote on the same day of the
      election, providing a fair and equal opportunity to the public. In most
      cases, it’s often younger generations, lower-income individuals, and
      people who come from marginalized communities who aren’t given the same
      opportunity to vote as those who are before election day. When same-day
      registration is accessible to the public it increases voter turnout along
      with providing convenience to voters as some may be inclined to register
      to vote more efficiently.

  - title: Restoring the right to vote for incarcerated people
    text: Restoring the right to vote for incarcerated people in Massachusetts is
      essential to the upholding of democracy and promoting reintegration and
      representation in our state. Allowing incarcerated individuals to vote is
      a huge step for providing reintegration into society as the right to vote
      is a fundamental right for all Americans. Restoring the right to vote for
      incarcerated individuals would uphold democratic beliefs that all citizens
      should have an equal opportunity to be represented. Guaranteeing
      representation for those who are incarcerated would help create a more
      inclusive and equitable society that doesn’t exclude those who have made
      mistakes in their past.
questions:
  - title: Incarnated people used to have the right to vote - Why did that change?
    text: In Massachusetts, incarcerated people once had the right to vote, yet that
      changed in 2000 when a state law revoked the right to vote for all
      individuals in prison. This unjust law was put in place after a house bill
      was passed to prohibit people incarcerated for felonies in state prison
      from voting. In Massachusetts, incarcerated individuals originally voted
      in large numbers and some of the public and policymakers thought that by
      allowing prisoners to vote they could potentially skew electoral outcomes
      specifically in criminal justice issues. There was also a common belief
      that voting should be seen as a privilege and that losing the right to
      vote was part of the punishment for being incarcerated. While this
      happened 23 years ago, much of the Massachusetts youth is in support of
      restoring the right to vote for incarcerated people. According to a [2023
      poll](https://www.masslive.com/politics/2023/09/should-formerly-incarcerated-people-get-the-right-to-vote-mass-pols-weigh-in.html)
      by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, 70% of voters aged 18 to 29 in
      the Commonwealth support the right to vote for incarcerated individuals
      which is great news in the fight to restore voting rights.
  - title: Why should campaign funds be used for childcare?
    text: In Massachusetts, the lack of access to childcare is a barrier for
      candidates running for office. Running for public office is a demanding
      and time-consuming process and many parents, especially women, face
      significant challenges balancing their responsibilities between their
      campaign and children. In Massachusetts, you can use campaign funds to
      rent a tuxedo but not for childcare which isn’t fair to parents running
      for public office. When allowing campaign funds to be used for childcare
      it can help create a more diverse and representative system that makes it
      easier for parents to participate in politics.
  - title: Is same-day voter registration the cure?
    text: Same-day voter registration isn’t the full cure for restoring the right to
      vote in Massachusetts but it’s one of the crucial steps our state needs to
      take to restore voting rights. Same-day voter registration benefits
      democracy as it increases voter turnout, increases the representation of
      diverse age groups and marginalized communities, and creates an easier and
      more accessible way to demonstrate our fundamental right to vote.
