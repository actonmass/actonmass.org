  - title: Ending Mandatory Minimum Sentencing
    text: "**In 2018, after years of delay, the Legislature passed a criminal
      justice reform bill. There were some important reforms made in that bill,
      but it didn’t go far enough. Reformers hoped to see a broad ability for
      juvenile expungement to prevent youth’s criminal records from haunting
      them the rest of their lives, but only a limited form of expungement was
      included. And instead of eliminating all mandatory minimum sentences, the
      bill created a new one.** Instead of making communities safer, mandatory
      minimums became a catalyst for mass incarceration, terrorizing Black
      communities and ignoring the root causes of poverty and crime.
      Massachusetts has much higher incarceration rates than we did in the
      1970's, and according to statewide sentencing data Black and Latinx
      residents make up just 23 percent of the state's population, but more than
      double the percentage of people serving mandatory minimum sentences for
      drug charges. This is not an accident. Our legislature had a chance to end
      mandatory minimums when they passed a criminal justice reform bill back in
      2018, but they left mandatory minimums in place and even created a few new
      ones. Mandatory minimum sentences don't work to reduce crime or
      incentivize lawful behavior, and should not be used as a substitute for
      accessible health care, a jobs guarantee, or mental health services. We
      need to end mandatory minimum sentencing this session."
  - title: Decertification
    text: Massachusetts is one of just a handful of states without certification for
      police officers, meaning that a cop who's fired by one town for
      misbehavior can get a job down the road in the next town. Police officers
      routinely violate constitutional law and rarely receive accountability,
      since there is very little stopping someone who has committed an act of
      violence from continuing to commit violence on the job elsewhere.
      Municipalities across the state have already made clear the need for
      certification and accountability. For example, Springfield's police
      department is so bad that even the Trump administration took notice and
      began an investigation into unconstitutional policing and systemic
      misconduct. A system of certification would prevent disgraced officers in
      Springfield from moving a few towns over and resuming police work
      unchanged.
  - title: Ending Qualified Immunity
    text: During the height of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, activists and
      organizers throughout the state stressed the need to end qualified
      immunity, which is designed to government employees from liability for
      unconstitutional actions. This means that when police officers commit acts
      of violence, there is no legal justification for bringing a case against
      them. Although ending qualified immunity did not ultimately make it into
      the final police reform bill passed last session, due to fierce opposition
      by the police unions, the Legislature has another opportunity to take
      meaningful action and end qualified immunity.

  #### MASS INCARCERATION


  Massachusetts has a relatively low incarceration rate compared to the rest of the country, but the number goes up when considering racial disparities. According to statewide sentencing data, Black and Latinx residents make up just 23 percent of the state’s population, but more than double the percentage of incarcerated people. We've had decades to address the impact of mass incarceration, and the epidemic of COVID cases occurring in prisons only increases the urgency. Incarceration is not a substitute for accessible health care, jobs programs, or mental health services. After years of delay, the Legislature passed a criminal justice reform bill in 2018 which included some important reforms, but didn’t go far enough. Reformers hoped to see a broad ability for juvenile expungement to prevent youth criminal records from haunting them the rest of their lives, but only limited expungement was included. And instead of eliminating all mandatory minimum sentences, the bill created new ones.




  #### POLICE REFORM


  Massachusetts is just a handful of states without certification for police officers, meaning that a police officer who’s fired by one town for misbehavior can get a job down the road in the next town. Police officers routinely violate constitutional law and rarely receive accountability, since there is very little stopping someone who has committed an act of violence from continuing to commit violence on the job elsewhere. This lack of consequences puts the entire community at risk. Municipalities across the state have already made clear the need for certification and accountability. Springfield’s police department is so bad that even the Trump administration took notice and began an investigation into unconstitutional policing and systemic misconduct. A system of certification and ending qualified immunity would prevent disgraced officers in Springfield from moving a few towns over and resuming police work unchanged. These reforms are not a substitute for defunding police budgets, which are clearly bloated and take away vital funding from needed public services. They do, however, establish a standard to which officers will have to adhere to in order to remain employed as police.

  - title: Isn’t Massachusetts really progressive on criminal justice?
    text: >-
      It’s a mixed bag. Massachusetts has a low overall incarceration rate, but
      some of the worst racial disparities. We have also been criticized for
      [sending more paroled prisoners back to prison than
      Texas](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2019/01/02/parole/?fbclid=IwAR1pVj1CJBGRyKWgUAW5SO6vcln-DW4ocCIMpltGnqKJr838RFRE_X5OL9M).
      Black and Latinx residents make up just 23 percent of the state's
      population, but more than double the percentage of people who are under
      mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related offenses.




      While other states are certainly worse, Massachusetts is no less guilty of investing in the prison industrial complex and enabling the overincarceration of Black and Latinx communities than the rest of the country. Mass incarceration is not a solution to poverty or crime. It is not a substitute for the state's responsibility to make health care a human right, to make good paying jobs available to every resident, to ensure that every child in the state receives a quality public education, or to invest in underresourced communities. No matter how much worse other states might be, the fact remains that thousands of people in Massachusetts are behind bars for reasons that should have never resulted in incarceration. That in itself is a human rights crisis.
  - title: If we just passed a major bill, doesn’t that mean the legislature is
      doing a good job?
    text: >
      We passed major reforms because advocacy works. Our legislature spent
      several years failing to act on mass incarceration after passing “tough on
      crime” legislation in the Clinton years. Activists spent multiple
      legislative sessions trying to push the legislature to do something and
      they finally did, but that is not what a progressive legislature looks
      like!


      And here’s the thing: inequities in our justice system typically follow other injustices in society.  Our legislature has been mostly silent on the things that would make sentencing reform most effective: housing, health care, and education.
