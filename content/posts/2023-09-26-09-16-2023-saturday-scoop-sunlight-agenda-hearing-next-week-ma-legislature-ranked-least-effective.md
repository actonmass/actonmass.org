Did you miss us, friend?

We took a few weeks off of the Scoop to focus on our organizing work because, frankly, there wasn’t much legislating happening for this legislative watchdog to watch. Beacon Hill took their typical August recess, holding only informal sessions and punting major business to the fall.

Well, I’m delighted to say that after four leisurely weeks of vacation, lawmakers hit the ground running by passing a handful of long-awaited progressive bills in their first two weeks back!

And if you believe that, I’ve got a bridge over the Charles River I’d like to sell you.

Nope, our fair lawmakers haven’t held a formal session since July 31st. If you’ve been wondering if this is typical behavior for a legislature, it’s not: last week, FiscalNote reported that the Massachusetts Legislature is officially [the least effective in the country](https://fiscalnote-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/FN080823-Most-Effective-States-WP_v2.pdf?utm_medium=&{{{EngagementData}}}&emci=1d235cac-b054-ee11-9937-00224832e811&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) in 2023.

For those keeping track at home, that’s our third “least” superlative of the fifty state legislatures, alongside least transparent, and least competitive elections. Hmm, I wonder if those could be connected somehow…

But even as the Legislature idles, the other mechanisms of lawmaking are kicking into high gear; last week, Attorney General Campbell [approved 34](https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023-09-06/questions-on-rent-control-mcas-tests-and-more-advance-toward-2024-ballot?utm_medium=&{{{EngagementData}}}&emci=1d235cac-b054-ee11-9937-00224832e811&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) prospective questions for the 2024 and 2026 ballots. These initiative petitions include (re-)enabling cities and towns to implement rent control, removing the MCAS graduation requirement, granting rideshare drivers (think Uber or Lyft) the right to unionize, and last but not least, explicitly granting the office of the Auditor the right to audit the Legislature, not that they need it or anything. (More on that below!)

But none of these are a done deal; the groups behind each question need to collect 75,000 signatures before the November deadline to ensure they make it on the ballot. And THEN the campaigning begins. 

All right, enough intro. There’s work to be done!

# Oops, All Take Action!

As the brave Cap’n once said, sometimes all you need are the berries. And in this case, the berries are a metaphor for grassroots political calls to action. 

In other words, just because the Legislature isn’t making a lot of news lately doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to do! With the ballot question signature gathering deadline right around the corner, and high-profile bills getting their committee hearings left and right, this is a make-or-break few months for many key progressive issues.  So, friend, refill that coffee cup, and take the next 10 minutes to submit testimony for these crucial bills:

A staff union contract would help improve democracy on Beacon Hill by increasing retention, removing staff pay as a negotiating tool in the hands of House and Senate leaders, and fostering a more efficient legislature that better serves its constituents. That’s why we’re fighting for this key bill as part of our Sunlight Agenda to restore Democratic Integrity on Beacon Hill!

Public higher education in Massachusetts has been defunded by 30% over the last two decades. That’s right – not 3%, 30%. This means the [cost burden has been shifted](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63d0977853043c29a5b9f414/t/641282ccba69c04808d61f88/1678938766581/Rising-Barriers-Shrinking-Aid.pdf?utm_medium=&{{{EngagementData}}}&emci=1d235cac-b054-ee11-9937-00224832e811&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) onto the students, who have to take on more and more crushing debt in order to earn a degree. The Cherish Act would fully fund public higher education (community colleges, state universities, and the UMass system) in Massachusetts – something we haven’t done since 2001. This bill has been filed in the Legislature two previous sessions, and died both times.

We need to raise **$5,000 in the next month** to ensure we can run a bold, effective grassroots campaign behind the Sunlight Agenda.

I don't know about you, but all these hearings and ballot questions are getting me excited, energized, and hopeful. There's just something about being a thorn in the Legislature's side that keeps me young. 

See you at the hearings next week,
