Oooof, my friend.

The legislature has officially wrapped up formal sessions, meaning that essentially anything that hasn‚Äôt been passed can be considered dead now. And that includes our bill to shed light on Beacon Hill: the Sunlight Act. üåöü™¶

That‚Äôs right, the bill to require all committee votes to be publicly available online, to subject the governor‚Äôs office to public records law, and to expand public access to the hearing process has died in the Senate Ways + Means committee.

Among the other priorities that have been left on the table:¬†

* Prison moratorium
* Preventing wage theft
* Right of state house staff to unionize
* Enhancing abortion access
* Medically-accurate, LGBTQ+ inclusive sex ed
* Same-day voter registration

And the list goes on and on‚Ä¶

While our legislators could technically pass bills all the way through the end of the year, the end of July marks the end of formal sessions, meaning anything from now on must be passed in informal sessions where votes are off the record and any single legislator can object and prevent a bill from passing.¬†

Ah, aren‚Äôt you so glad we elected a democratic supermajority trifecta to pass crucial progressive policy? üôÉ¬†

There is a loophole here: technically, the legislature could call a special formal session and come back to vote on major policies. Our elected officials could choose to reconvene and hash out major priorities they promised, like a sweeping climate bill, addressing the Steward health crisis and impending community hospital closures, or funding our shelter program.¬†

And to that I say: Do it, I dare you!

## State House Scoop

**Healey imposes cruel limits and penalties for emergency overflow shelter stays**

Speaking of the shelter system ‚Äî [eviction notices have gone out to 57 families](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/08/07/metro/they-dont-have-anywhere-go-mass-advocates-push-back-5-day-limit-overflow-migrant-shelters/?utm_medium=&emci=27c1bb4a-1757-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) staying in the emergency overflow shelters in accordance with Healey administration policy limiting the right-to-shelter in Massachusetts. Back in May, Healey imposed a [30-day limit](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/03/25/metro/maura-healey-emergency-shelter-migrant-crisis-overflow-sites/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&utm_medium=&emci=27c1bb4a-1757-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) on stays in overflow shelters with limited opportunities to reapply monthly. But now, **the administration has slashed that to a 5-day limit and [added a penalty](https://www.mass.gov/doc/ea-family-shelter-fact-sheet-faq/download?utm_medium=&emci=27c1bb4a-1757-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) making anyone who has stayed in an emergency overflow shelter ineligible for family shelter for 6 months.**¬†

Read that bold part back; soak in *just how cruel* it is.

We are in a state with an ostensible right to shelter. We are in a state that is run by a supermajority of Democrats. And yet this state is cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes for the wealthy and leaving our shelter system hundreds of millions of dollars underfunded.¬†

My friend, you should be enraged.¬†

But it only gets more disgusting from here. Along with these new policies comes a shift in language from the Healey administration, seemingly just euphemisms for her inhumane policies. The administration is trying to downplay the severity of these actions by now referring to emergency overflow shelters as ‚Äútemporary respite centers.‚Äù And they‚Äôre ‚Äú[reticketing](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/03/metro/migrants-logan-healey-reticketing/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&utm_medium=&emci=27c1bb4a-1757-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}})‚Äù dozens of families, which is a really soft way of saying they‚Äôre shipping people out of Massachusetts. How this policy is different from the relocation policies of [Republican governors](https://www.masslive.com/news/2022/09/migrants-flown-to-marthas-vineyard-will-now-be-offered-shelter-at-joint-base-cape-cod-shelter.html?outputType=amp&utm_medium=&emci=27c1bb4a-1757-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}), which Healey previously regarded as ‚Äú[incredibly cruel](https://www.masslive.com/politics/2022/09/was-desantis-sending-migrants-to-marthas-vineyard-a-crime-healey-wont-say.html?utm_medium=&emci=27c1bb4a-1757-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}})‚Äù is unclear.¬†

While our Democratic supermajority government continues to underfund our shelter system and evict people from homeless shelters, a [new report](https://www.bostonindicators.org/-/media/indicators/boston-indicators-reports/report-files/homelessness-in-greater-boston-8524-pdf.pdf?utm_medium=&emci=27c1bb4a-1757-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) has been released showing that the Greater Boston area has the 2nd highest homelessness rate in the country, growing by 27% between 2022 and 2023.¬†

The report also found that racial disparities exist in the extremes when it comes to the unhoused population: the rate of unhoused Black people is 11 times higher than that of white people. The majority of people experiencing housing insecurity in Greater Boston are families. And by age group, the highest rate of homelessness experienced by children under 18.¬†

The new 5-day limit is a cruel, despicable, and deliberate policy choice by Maura Healey that is hurting the most vulnerable of our neighbors. And yet the Democratic Governor continues to send them eviction notices, to the streets, or with a one-way ticket out of Massachusetts.¬†
