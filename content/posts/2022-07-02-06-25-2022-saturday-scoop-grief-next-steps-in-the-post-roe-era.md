It’s hard to know what to say at times like this. We like to think that, over time, things are getting better. That we’re making progress, that each new generation will have more rights and will live in a more equitable world than the one before them. But that’s just not true. Not right now, anyways.

The repeal of Roe v. Wade, a 50 year old legal precedent, is shocking and violent. This decision, made by a Supreme Court in which 5 of the 9 justices were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, will result in lives lost and the further oppression of women, trans folks, non-binary folks, BIPOC communities, low-income communities, and young people. 

Alongside my grief, fear, and anger, I’ve been thinking about how this happened, especially given the fact that the vast[ majority](https://click.everyaction.com/k/46963014/352523033/-1588500937?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjA5NmNjNzUyLWE1ZjQtZWMxMS1iNDdhLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibm1hMjNAYnUuZWR1Ig0KfQ%3D%3D&hmac=6Z9tO7ePDX2QsZzuI4getfLqB0JmSVLixIWvC7rE3NA=&emci=3e5a04cf-9cf4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=096cc752-a5f4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&ceid=21506428) of Americans support the right to abortion.

But when our systems are designed to reflect the desires and values of a wealthy, white supremacist, patriarchal class, those in power aren’t held accountable to what the rest of us want. This is what’s at stake when we talk about our failing democracy. 

As I’m writing this today, I don’t have any sweeping answers. I’m scared and I’m tired. All I know is that I’m grateful for you, and for being in a progressive people-powered movement with you. 

## **State House Scoop**

**Abortion access in Massachusetts\
First and foremost, abortion is still legal in Massachusetts.** If you or someone you know is seeking an abortion, they can find a list of providers [here](https://click.everyaction.com/k/46963016/352523035/656429972?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjA5NmNjNzUyLWE1ZjQtZWMxMS1iNDdhLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibm1hMjNAYnUuZWR1Ig0KfQ%3D%3D&hmac=6Z9tO7ePDX2QsZzuI4getfLqB0JmSVLixIWvC7rE3NA=&emci=3e5a04cf-9cf4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=096cc752-a5f4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&ceid=21506428). This right was codified into law through the Roe Act which passed last session–just in the nick of time. Also in the nick of time, Governor Baker signed an executive action Friday immediately after the Supreme Court decision to protect MA healthcare providers from charges from other states for providing reproductive care, and ban our state agencies from cooperating with other state’s investigations into abortions. 

 Meanwhile, funding for abortion services in the 2023 budget is currently being negotiated behind closed doors; the House had proposed $500,000 for abortion access, and the Senate proposed $2 million. But solutions to a crisis on this scale have to go beyond an earmark in the budget; check out the [policy agenda](https://click.everyaction.com/k/46963017/352523036/-917641432?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjA5NmNjNzUyLWE1ZjQtZWMxMS1iNDdhLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibm1hMjNAYnUuZWR1Ig0KfQ%3D%3D&hmac=6Z9tO7ePDX2QsZzuI4getfLqB0JmSVLixIWvC7rE3NA=&emci=3e5a04cf-9cf4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=096cc752-a5f4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&ceid=21506428) laid out by the Massachusetts Beyond Roe Coalition, of which Act on Mass is proud to be a part.  

**House passes transportation bill, excludes low-income fare program**The House unanimously passed a $11 billion bond bill Thursday to address the MBTA’s recent safety and staffing issues and set aside some early funding for an east-west rail. But like any House bill, it’s not all good news: instead of making it easier and more affordable to use public transportation, especially amid record-high gas prices, legislators opted to remove a [popular](https://click.everyaction.com/k/46963018/352523037/1792308383?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjA5NmNjNzUyLWE1ZjQtZWMxMS1iNDdhLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibm1hMjNAYnUuZWR1Ig0KfQ%3D%3D&hmac=6Z9tO7ePDX2QsZzuI4getfLqB0JmSVLixIWvC7rE3NA=&emci=3e5a04cf-9cf4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=096cc752-a5f4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&ceid=21506428) [](https://click.everyaction.com/k/46963019/352523038/1792308383?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjA5NmNjNzUyLWE1ZjQtZWMxMS1iNDdhLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibm1hMjNAYnUuZWR1Ig0KfQ%3D%3D&hmac=6Z9tO7ePDX2QsZzuI4getfLqB0JmSVLixIWvC7rE3NA=&emci=3e5a04cf-9cf4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=096cc752-a5f4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&ceid=21506428)low-income fare program from the final version of the bill.

**Criminal record sealing bill deadline approaches**Under current law, an individual’s criminal record can be sealed after a wait period, but the process to request a seal once that period is over includes lengthy wait times and labyrinthine red tape. A bill that would automatically seal criminal records, making it easier for millions of MA residents to access jobs, schooling, and housing from which they would otherwise be denied, currently [sits in committee](https://click.everyaction.com/k/46963020/352523039/250780801?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjA5NmNjNzUyLWE1ZjQtZWMxMS1iNDdhLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibm1hMjNAYnUuZWR1Ig0KfQ%3D%3D&hmac=6Z9tO7ePDX2QsZzuI4getfLqB0JmSVLixIWvC7rE3NA=&emci=3e5a04cf-9cf4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=096cc752-a5f4-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&ceid=21506428) with a 6/30 decision deadline. State House leadership could easily have this advance out of committee and fast-track it to a floor vote if they wanted to.

## **Take Action**

**Donate to your local abortion fund**
While abortion remains legal in Massachusetts, there are still several other barriers to access including financial. Abortion funds help people pay for their abortion and other logistical expenses like travel, lodging, and child care.

**Tell budget negotiators to include at least $2 million for abortion services**

The good news is that both the House and Senate have earmarked funds for reproductive health care, including grants to directly support abortion funds in Massachusetts. However, the Senate has set aside four times as much money: $2 million. We must ensure that the conference committee maintains the Senate’s funding levels to ensure we are maximizing the support we can provide for abortion care in Massachusetts.
