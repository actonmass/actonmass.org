It's the final days of pride friend, and summer is coming into full swing!

And while it’s not specifically for pride month, this queer organizer is surely celebrating the addition of [googly eyes to a handful of MBTA trains](https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/06/26/mbta-subway-cars-googly-eyes-joy?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) this week! That’s right — in response to organizing by a group called Googly Eyes on the MBTA, who held a rally at Park Street station several weeks ago, the MBTA has installed giant googly eyes on select green line and commuter rail trains. Who can be upset when a big goofy googly-eyed train rolls in to pick you up? Certainly not me! 🤪

In less goofy news, it looks like we’re on track to go into the new fiscal year and not have a state budget for the [14th year in a row](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/26/metro/massachusetts-legislature-state-budget-late-14th-straight-year/?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}). Barring a miracle tomorrow, the new fiscal year will ring in on Monday with the final budget still being hashed out in a closed-door conference committee. 

Not to mention, it’s almost the end of the legislative session, which means we have just four weeks left to get crucial policies passed by lawmakers before they go on recess for the rest of the summer. 

And with that, I would be remiss not to ask you, {{FirstName or "Friend"}}, to contact your Senator in support of the Sunlight Act:

## State House Scoop

**Senate *also* capitulates to Greater Boston Real Estate Board lobbying**

In some ways, it is actually finally starting to look like the end of the legislative session. The Senate took up some critical policies they’ve been saying they’d get to this session, including [passing their version of the Housing Bond bill](https://www.necn.com/news/local/ma-senate-passes-housing-bill/3269972/?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) that the House passed a few weeks back. In it are similar policies, like allowing accessory dwelling units (ADUs, or in-law suites) to be built in single-family zoning lots, eviction record sealing protections, and requiring brokers’ fees to be paid solely by the party that contracted them. These are some really big wins and something we'll be keeping our eye out for in the final version of the bill.

Notably *not* in the bill is the real estate transfer fee — a tool to funnel a small amount of money from high-dollar real estate transactions towards affordable housing in the community that was nixed by the House after [aggressive lobbying](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/04/24/business/real-estate-board-opposes-transfer-fees/?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) from the Greater Boston Real Estate Board. Gee, it’s a good thing we don’t need more money for affordable hous— oh wait...

**Senate passes climate bill, omitting key environmental justice language**

The Senate also hashed out their long-promised climate package this week, passing it on Tuesday. The bill includes some crucial good policies, like requiring gas companies to plan a decommissioning of the gas pipeline system while encouraging geothermal energy as an alternative.

However, while the bill contains some language to ensure the state’s transition to sustainable energy, it’s missing key environmental justice language and policies. Several amendments that would have halted the gas industry from furthering their gas distribution systems were struck down, as well as ones that would have provided funding for decarbonization measures, ensured sustainable energy laborers are paid a prevailing wage, and removed subsidies for burning biomass. Our friends at Progressive Mass have put together an [in-depth breakdown](https://www.progressivemass.com/senate-climate-bill-june-2024/?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) of what did and didn’t make it into the final climate package, which you can read [here](https://www.progressivemass.com/senate-climate-bill-june-2024/?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}). 

The House now has a chance to respond with their own climate package, which organizers are pushing to include stronger and explicit environmental justice measures to protect the most vulnerable communities among us.

**Syd’s Sprinkles: State flounders (yet again) on shelter funding crisis***Welcome to Syd’s Sprinkles! A new Scoop section where I, Sydney the Act on Mass Policy Fellow for the summer, tell you everything you need to know (or wish you didn’t) about the status of key issues before the Legislature.*

In an attempt to address the increasing shelter crisis in the state, Governor Healey sent a five-member team down to Texas this past week to tell incoming migrants that [Massachusetts no longer has the space to house and support them](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/06/25/our-shelters-are-full-healey-sends-officials-to-texas-to-deter-migrants-from-heading-to-mass/?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}). That’s right — the governor spent [more money](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/28/metro/migrant-crisis-healey-texas-border-shelter-cost/?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) on a trip to go tell people that we are out of money and space in the shelter system. This [“educational” trip](https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-sends-administration-officials-to-southern-border?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20trip%20is%20an%20important,Assistance%20Director%20General%20Scott%20Rice.) comes just days before the state will begin to issue what are essentially eviction notices to families currently being sheltered who are approaching the Healey administration’s 9-month stay limit.

Going on this trip to [“get the word out that our shelters are full so that families can plan accordingly to make sure they have a safe place to go”](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/massachusetts-migrant-shelters-full-texas/?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}), doesn’t seem like it will help families all that much, especially when they may not have access to resources to go elsewhere. After all, an emergency shelter is for… emergencies. 

In another failure to provide resources, the House recently rejected an amendment to the supplemental budget that would have provided access to benefits for immigrants living in Massachusetts. Since federal immigration law has lots of gaps in it, immigrants who are living in Massachusetts legally may not be entitled to federal assistance like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). [The rejected amendment](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/27/metro/massachusetts-house-immigrant-snap-benefit/?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}), filed by Rep. Cabral, would’ve funded another $6 million to SNAP for children of immigrants. 

When House speaker Mariano was asked about this amendment this past Wednesday, he said that this was the ["first thing I've heard of it,”](https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/06/27/immigrant-food-aid-plan-mass-legislature?utm_medium=&emci=ed13161c-3e36-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) and that $6 million is “a significant amount of money.”

Out of the $540 million supplemental budget that was passed by the House this week, the rejected $6 million would amount to just 0.01% of that budget. That 0.01% of spending would’ve gone to help support families and children who are at the heart of the state of emergency and in dire need of support.

**Help make sure the Prison Moratorium and Elder Parole bills get passed this session**

Our friends at Families for Justice as Healing and National Council are hosting a number of events between now and the end of session to make noise about the Prison Moratorium and Elder Parole bills. The prison population in MA is declining and the production of new prisons would only serve to encourage more unnecessary incarceration.
