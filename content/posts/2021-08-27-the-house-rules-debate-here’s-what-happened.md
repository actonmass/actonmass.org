In April 2021, we launched [The People’s House](https://actonmass.org/the-campaign/) campaign - a grassroots lobbying campaign for commonsense rules reform in the MA State House. This campaign was aimed at the adoption of three changes to the House Rules: 



1) Make all committee votes public

2) Ensure reps and the public have 72 hours to read a bill before a vote

3) Reinstate an 8 year term limit for the Speaker of the House. 



The House Rules debate took place on July 7, 2021, and despite months of advocacy and widespread support, our three amendments were voted down. We didn’t get anywhere near the 81 votes we needed to pass our amendments. You can see how your rep voted on these three amendments [here](https://click.everyaction.com/k/32096049/294704172/-1864848921?usp=sharing&utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwY2QyNzkyLTQ0ZTAtZWIxMS1hN2FkLTUwMWFjNTdiOGZhNyIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAicnVzc2RhdmlzQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Ig0KfQ%3D%3D&hmac=PhMbUVCtUF2TcLouW5znX7DoDHYwmUcctGSOdm69ANk=&emci=ba2bebf5-41e0-eb11-a7ad-501ac57b8fa7&emdi=70cd2792-44e0-eb11-a7ad-501ac57b8fa7&ceid=9418353). 



However, July 7th also came with many victories for our movement, including a major concession that “no” votes in committees will be listed, by name, on the legislature’s website. This puts the House Rules on par with the anticipated Joint Rules (which have been in conference committee since February).



Read on to learn more about our wins, our losses, which reps voted which way and why, who spoke on the floor about these amendments and what they said, what the press coverage looked like, and our takeaways as a movement.
