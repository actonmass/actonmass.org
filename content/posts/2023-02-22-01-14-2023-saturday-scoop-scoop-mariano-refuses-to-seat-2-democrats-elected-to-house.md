This week the weather matched the news: mostly dreary and drizzly, with a few peeks of sunshine. 

First, the sunshine: bees are going to get their first ever [vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/07/science/honeybee-vaccine.html?utm_medium=&emci=4f368853-7693-ed11-9d7b-00224832e811&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) against common diseases (it’s administered through food, not a tiny bee-sized needle, as I had imagined), the ozone hole is projected to [close entirely](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-64215660?utm_medium=&emci=4f368853-7693-ed11-9d7b-00224832e811&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) within the next 40 years, and Norwell, Massachusetts native Jennifer Coolidge [stole the show](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/11/entertainment/jennifer-coolidge-acceptance-speech-golden-globes/index.html?utm_medium=&emci=4f368853-7693-ed11-9d7b-00224832e811&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) at the Golden Globes.  

And now, the drizzle: up on Beacon Hill, the Speaker of the House is refusing to seat two newly elected Democratic reps who beat their Republican opponents by narrow margins, flipping both districts from red to blue. 

Kind of a weird way to kick off the new Democratic trifecta, if you ask me.

Let this serve as a reminder to all of us: just because Democrats hold all the highest positions in the state (majorities in the House and Senate, plus the Governor), this is by no means a guarantee of progressive, or even “lower-case d” democratic rule. 

Without a Republican governor to hide behind, it will be interesting to see legislative leadership’s true colors. And with the glimpse I’ve gotten thus far, it’s not looking pretty.

## **State House Scoop**

**Mariano refuses to swear in two new Democratic reps, caves to Republicans**

It’s been over two months since the polls closed in November, and yet the outcomes of two House races have yet to be determined. Well, sort of. Despite a public recount and certification of those results, it turns out that Speaker Mariano actually has the final say in who gets sworn in and who doesn’t.

Yes, you read that right: according to MA legal precedent, the House \[read: the Speaker] chooses whether to seat newly-elected representatives, and could even call for a new election if he wanted to. (I thought there was nothing left that could shock me about the power of the Speaker at this point, but here we are.)  Last week, Speaker Mariano announced he [would not swear in](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/01/11/metro/no-election-is-safe-amid-rise-election-deniers-house-decision-delay-democrats-swearing-in-touches-nerve-party/?utm_medium=&emci=4f368853-7693-ed11-9d7b-00224832e811&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) Democrats Kristin Kassner of the 2nd Essex and Margaret Scarsdale of the 1st Middlesex, caving to persistent legal and political pressure from their Republican opponents. 

Yesterday, a panel hand-picked by Mariano convened at a [hearing](https://commonwealthmagazine.org/politics/2-republicans-blame-human-error-in-unusual-election-challenge/?utm_medium=&emci=4f368853-7693-ed11-9d7b-00224832e811&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) to review the certified election results with each candidate and their legal team in attendance. It’s unclear what the panel will do with the arguments they heard, or when they will make any further decisions, leaving the constituents of the 2nd Essex and 1st Middlesex districts in the lurch.

**Spilka, Healey express support for free community college (at least for some)**

Ringing in the new legislative session, the Big Three (the Speaker of the House, the Senate President, and the Governor) had their first meeting this week to discuss their policy priorities. Both President Spilka and Governor Healey took the opportunity to announce their respective plans for free community college here in the Bay State–a fantastic step towards making higher education affordable for all. But their proposals differ starkly over a key question: free for whom? The Senate President’s plan would make community college free for everyone (good!), the governor would only make it free for people 25 and older who don’t have a college degree (less good!), and the Speaker didn’t consider it a priority at all (bad!). 

Making community colleges free for everyone would be an incredible investment in low-income communities for whom cost is a barrier to higher education, as well as the younger generations as a whole who find themselves having to take on crushing debt in order to earn a degree. Next step? Make all public universities tuition-free. If only there were a [bill](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H1339/Bills?utm_medium=&emci=4f368853-7693-ed11-9d7b-00224832e811&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) for that…
