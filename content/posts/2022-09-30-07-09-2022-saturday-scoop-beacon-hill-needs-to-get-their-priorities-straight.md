There are just three weeks left in the legislative session, and instead of finishing the laundry list of bills passed by only one chamber, leadership is heaping more and more bills onto their plates. Time will tell if their eyes are bigger than their stomachs.

One bill in particular was sped through the [committee process](https://www.eagletribune.com/news/boston/baker-tax-relief-bill-clears-committee/article_175316b2-fbb5-11ec-b164-ab9222b48cbb.html?utm_medium=&emci=deccaf7c-94ff-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) this week, seemingly getting fast-tracked to Baker’s desk. I wish I could tell you it was all good news, but I wouldn't lie to you like that. 

The bill? Governor Baker’s $700 million tax cuts, first filed back in January. While the House’s version of the bill no longer includes language to slash the capital gains tax (thank God), it does still include one big cut for the wealthy: doubling the threshold for the estate tax from $1 million to $2 million. 

I thought we elected a Democratic supermajority to act as a check on our Republican governor, not so they can help him cut taxes for the wealthy. That’s what I get for making assumptions!

## **State House Scoop**



**Senate passes childcare reform bill**\
The Senate unanimously [passed](https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/07/08/early-education-child-care-reform-legislation?utm_medium=&emci=deccaf7c-94ff-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) a bill on Thursday to improve access to early child care in Massachusetts. Inspired by the [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-SjLTTCJ6WTbCMHhgLuVV3WkmVh1DZas/view?utm_medium=&emci=deccaf7c-94ff-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) from earlier this year that concluded the state was in need of a $1.5 billion investment in this sector, this legislation aims to make childcare more affordable and stabilize the industry. Specifically, the bill would expand eligibility for financial assistance for childcare, and establish grants and loan forgiveness for childcare providers. But how much of the $1.5 billion needed would this bill actually invest in child care? $0. As Senator Chang-Díaz [pointed out](https://twitter.com/SenChangDiaz/status/1545175404960530432?utm_medium=&emci=deccaf7c-94ff-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}), the bill is largely aspirational and would require funding to be impactful. She says: “This bill is definitely better than nothing. But better than nothing is not the standard we should be holding ourselves to on Beacon Hill.” I can’t say it better than the Senator, so I won’t even try!

**House & Senate vote to extend remote participation in town governments**\
Both chambers voted this week to extend pandemic-era reforms that allow public bodies (i.e. city councils, select boards) to conduct official business remotely. The House’s version included an amendment to make hybrid meetings a permanent option for groups subject to Open Meeting Law, ensuring the public could attend their local government meetings both in person or remotely. I’m thrilled that the House feels so strongly about the sanctity of Open Meeting Law–so strongly, in fact, that they’re one of the few state legislatures in the country that has exempted themselves from it.

**House proposes $250 tax rebates, low-income individuals not eligible**

Since learning that we collected a sizable revenue surplus on tax day, our legislators have had a rare problem to solve: how are we going to spend all this extra money? (I wish I had that problem...) One solution, [announced](https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/07/07/lawmakers-announce-250-and-500-one-time-payments-for-some-massachusetts-residents?utm_medium=&emci=deccaf7c-94ff-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) by the House on Thursday, is to give some of it back to the taxpayers in the form of $250 rebates. Well, not all taxpayers: to qualify, your annual income must be between $38,000 and $100,000. Ah, yes, I agree–people making less than $38,000 per year in Massachusetts have had it too easy for far too long!

## **Ballot Question Update: WE’RE ON THE BALLOT**

WE DID IT! The deadline to collect signatures for our non-binding ballot question was Wednesday of this past week, and our amazing volunteers turned in *thousands* of signatures to town clerks across the Commonwealth. Two months of signature collection and conversations with voters has all led up to this. I could not be more proud and grateful for everyone who made it possible. Because of you, hundreds of thousands of voters will have a voice on State House transparency and single payer healthcare this November.  

While we turned in all the signatures we had on Wednesday, they still need to be certified by the town clerks. We don't know yet for certain in which districts we reached the 200 certified signature threshold. As soon as we hear back from the clerks, we’ll announce the final tally of districts where our question will be on the ballot–stay tuned!

**Help pass the Jail and Prison Construction Moratorium Bill!**

**Help pass the Jail and Prison Construction Moratorium Bill!**

The House and the Senate both passed some [prison moratorium](https://actonmass.org/bills/prison-moratorium/?utm_medium=&emci=deccaf7c-94ff-ec11-b47a-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) language as a part of an infrastructure spending bill. But while the language in the House's version is very close to the original bill, the Senate's version is much weaker, and *would not stop the women's prison project.* 

**Here’s what you can do:**

* Call the six Conference Committee members and tell them to put the House version of the Moratorium in the final bill.
* Call your own State Rep and Senator and tell them to ask the Infrastructure Bond Bill Committee members to put the House version of the Moratorium in the final bill.
