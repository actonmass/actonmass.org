We’re deep in the throes of August, formal sessions of the legislative session are over, and everyone seems to be on vacation. Even I skipped The Scoop last week because I was relaxing on the Cape (and I bet you didn’t even notice!). 

Unless leaders call an emergency formal session to pass some bills they didn’t pass before they gaveled out on 8/1 (something many advocates are calling on them to do), the legislature typically only passes small, uncontroversial bills for the rest of the year.

This year there seems to be one exception, however: legislative leaders have suggested they hope to pass parts of the economic development bill that got shelved at the last minute due to the “discovery” of a 1986 [tax refund law](https://click.everyaction.com/k/49514733/362432002/-1791026358?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogImU3NjU2N2I4LWJhMjAtZWQxMS1iZDZlLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibmF0YWxpZWFzaXRpbWJheUBnbWFpbC5jb20iDQp9&hmac=TiI7XB2bJcWd1pSvqR7MUfgbSEmQ745obVzNKscNwmk=&emci=944061c5-b520-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&emdi=e76567b8-ba20-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&ceid=24441477). I certainly wouldn’t shed a tear if the [estate tax](https://click.everyaction.com/k/49514734/362432003/2087437025?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogImU3NjU2N2I4LWJhMjAtZWQxMS1iZDZlLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibmF0YWxpZWFzaXRpbWJheUBnbWFpbC5jb20iDQp9&hmac=TiI7XB2bJcWd1pSvqR7MUfgbSEmQ745obVzNKscNwmk=&emci=944061c5-b520-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&emdi=e76567b8-ba20-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&ceid=24441477) remained intact, but in addition to tax cuts the economic development bill also outlined funding mechanisms for several bills that did pass, like the green energy bill. And without funding, most bills are just, to use some technical political jargon, “vibes.” 

 Let's get into it.

## **State House Scoop**

**Baker signs majority of last-minute legislation, including green energy bill**

By leaving so many critical bills to the last minute, legislative leaders ran out of time to override any vetoes Baker might issue, giving our Republican governor final say on a number of bills. Luckily, Baker signed most of the bills piled on his desk at the end of the session. Some high-profile last minute bills signed into law include the bill to legalize sports betting, a bill to improve mental health access, and a cannabis industry reform bill.  1

Much to the relief of climate activists, Governor Baker also signed this session’s sweeping green energy bill, despite having “[deep misgivings](https://click.everyaction.com/k/49514735/362432004/-453218967?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogImU3NjU2N2I4LWJhMjAtZWQxMS1iZDZlLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibmF0YWxpZWFzaXRpbWJheUBnbWFpbC5jb20iDQp9&hmac=TiI7XB2bJcWd1pSvqR7MUfgbSEmQ745obVzNKscNwmk=&emci=944061c5-b520-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&emdi=e76567b8-ba20-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&ceid=24441477).” This bill would provide a boost to the state’s offshore wind industry and aims to put Massachusetts on track to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This is fantastic news, but it should never have been left to chance; our ability to stave off climate catastrophe shouldn’t be dependent on the exact “depth” of Charlie Baker’s “misgivings.” Hopefully next session will be the first in years in which the final decision on a major climate bill is not left in the hands of a Republican governor.

 **State raises MCAS requirement, doubling down on standardized testing**

Bad news for high school students, parents of students, educators, immigrant families, and families with children with disabilities: it just got harder to graduate from high school in Massachusetts. For non-Massachusetts natives like myself, the MCAS (Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System) is a standardized test all high schoolers must pass in order to graduate. Massachusetts is one of only 11 states with such a requirement, and the state Board of Education voted on Monday to [raise the minimum](https://click.everyaction.com/k/49514736/362432006/-495222029?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogImU3NjU2N2I4LWJhMjAtZWQxMS1iZDZlLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibmF0YWxpZWFzaXRpbWJheUBnbWFpbC5jb20iDQp9&hmac=TiI7XB2bJcWd1pSvqR7MUfgbSEmQ745obVzNKscNwmk=&emci=944061c5-b520-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&emdi=e76567b8-ba20-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&ceid=24441477) passing score. This move is opposed by, well, pretty much *everyone*; when the proposal was open for public comments in June, 98% of comments made were opposed to the change. Teachers unions like MTA have been actively pushing to eliminate the MCAS for years (which is in fact one of our [priority bills](https://click.everyaction.com/k/49514737/362432007/-334918328?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogImU3NjU2N2I4LWJhMjAtZWQxMS1iZDZlLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibmF0YWxpZWFzaXRpbWJheUBnbWFpbC5jb20iDQp9&hmac=TiI7XB2bJcWd1pSvqR7MUfgbSEmQ745obVzNKscNwmk=&emci=944061c5-b520-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&emdi=e76567b8-ba20-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&ceid=24441477)). This is another example of a popular and increasingly vital bill that never saw the light of day this past session–it was sent to study.

## **In Memoriam: The Graveyard of the 192nd Session**

Now that our legislature is through with major business for the rest of the year, it’s time to take a look back through the 192nd legislative session to acknowledge some of the popular progressive bills that died, yet again.

 **Safe Communities Act**\
What better place to start than a bill with one of the biggest movements behind it: the [Safe Communities Act](https://click.everyaction.com/k/49514738/362432008/672723279?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogImU3NjU2N2I4LWJhMjAtZWQxMS1iZDZlLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibmF0YWxpZWFzaXRpbWJheUBnbWFpbC5jb20iDQp9&hmac=TiI7XB2bJcWd1pSvqR7MUfgbSEmQ745obVzNKscNwmk=&emci=944061c5-b520-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&emdi=e76567b8-ba20-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&ceid=24441477). This bill, first filed in 2013 (*The Office* was still on the air, Obama just began his second term, I wasn’t old enough to drink…you get the picture), would prevent local and state law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, and would prohibit police from asking about individuals’ immigration status. Over half of legislators are signed on as cosponsors, and it is supported by a coalition of over [one hundred](https://click.everyaction.com/k/49514739/362432009/-1500246086?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogImU3NjU2N2I4LWJhMjAtZWQxMS1iZDZlLTI4MTg3OGI4M2Q4YSIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAibmF0YWxpZWFzaXRpbWJheUBnbWFpbC5jb20iDQp9&hmac=TiI7XB2bJcWd1pSvqR7MUfgbSEmQ745obVzNKscNwmk=&emci=944061c5-b520-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&emdi=e76567b8-ba20-ed11-bd6e-281878b83d8a&ceid=24441477) organizations. 

This bill has now been killed by being “sent to study” five sessions in a row. This session it was strung along to the very end, keeping hopeful advocates on their toes. The deadline for the first committee decision was extended not once, not twice, but three times. In late June, it was reported favorably out of the Public Safety and Homeland Security committee. But just because a bill makes it out of the first committee doesn’t mean it’ll get passed; SCA sat in Ways & Means for the last month of the session and was never brought to a vote. This is what we at Act on Mass mean when we say “death via Ways & Means.”

## **We're Still Mad**

**Spilka’s refusal to recognize State House Employee's Union: Blog Post**\
In the middle of the busiest time of the session for state house staffers, and just days before staff would be asked to work a 23-hour shift, Senate President Karen Spilka formally rejected the Senate staffers’ right to unionize. And frankly, we’re not done talking about it. Act on Mass is proud to stand in solidarity with MSHEU and is calling on all legislators, candidates, and advocates to stand in solidarity as well.
