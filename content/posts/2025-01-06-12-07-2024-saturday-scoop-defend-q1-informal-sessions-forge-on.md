Good morning, 

Brrrrrr. It’s getting chilly out there! Believe it or not, this is actually the kind of MA day that I missed in my years living elsewhere. When you’re all bundled up, there’s something satisfying about cold air in the lungs. 

It also makes gathering together in the warmth all the more fun. Which - as you might’ve heard - we’ll be doing tomorrow, in Quincy! Today’s your last chance to get a [ticket](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319877/516273324/-865451560?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377) to join our end-of-year Transparency Bash. It’ll be a fun time: we’ll have snacks and some chit-chat, discussion about the year and the one to come, and then a conversation with Auditor Diana DiZoglio. You'll also help support our fundraiser, where we're just $1000 short of our goal!

## State House Scoop

**Defend Question 1 campaign forges on** 

This was a busy week for defenders of government accountability and transparency in Massachusetts. As you’d know from previous Scoops, Act on Mass has been actively working since the election to Defend Question 1: the right to a full legislative audit as passed by voters on November 5th. But the fight has gone on much longer than that. Ever since voters elected Auditor Diana DiZoglio in 2022 on a campaign promise to audit the legislature, this audit has been an uphill battle. 

First, the legislature claimed that the Auditor’s office did not have the right to audit them, because this right was not explicitly stated in the Massachusetts law that outlines the auditor’s authority to audit. This was then posed to the voters in Question 1, which alters Massachusetts’ General Laws to clarify that the auditor has the authority to audit the legislature. 

In response to voter’s overwhelming support for Question 1, which was the most popular issue on the ballot with 72% of the vote, legislative leaders responded with an attempt to water down the audit. We discussed this a few weeks ago– they took an unprecedented move of altering the House Rules in the last few weeks of session in order to assign the Auditor with the task of selecting the House’s independent financial auditing firm, [pitching](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319879/516273326/366448747?utm_medium=&emci=8d89afd4-48a4-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&emdi=981ba7cf-70a4-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&ceid=9413674&&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=) the change as an “opportunity to acknowledge the 70-30 vote of the electorate” on Question 1. 

Recently, the legislature has taken a new tact: claiming that they have no need yet to respond, because the law has not yet passed into effect. They claim that the ballot question law will not go into effect until 30 days from the certification of the election, which took place on Wednesday. This would bump the date of the new audit law taking effect to January 5th, 2025. 

At best, this claim rings like a “well, actually” from that one guy in the group that always wants to play devil’s advocate. This was not a tight election: the measure passed with 72% of the vote. Yet, legislative leaders refuse to even meet with the auditor’s office. 

And at worst, this claim actually looks to be a very narrow and deliberate manipulation of the language of MA election law as stated in the Constitution, with the goal of delaying compliance with the audit. 

Unlike most of the *votes* taken by our dear legislature, the MA Constitution is fully accessible to the public and searchable [online](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319880/516273327/579811714?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377#amendmentArticleXLVIIIInitiative). Article 48 outlines the people’s right to initiative petition - that is, making laws via a ballot question. It states that when passed by a majority of the voters, such laws “**shall take effect in thirty days after such state election** or at such time after such election as may be provided in such law.” Seeing as Question 1 provided no alternative timeline of its’ taking effect, a plain reading of the Constitution would suggest that the law entered into force this Thursday, December 5th. 

This week, Act on Mass hosted a [press conference](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319881/516273328/1070047052?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377) at the State House with Auditor Diana DiZoglio to bring attention to this discrepancy. We weren’t the only ones with this interpretation. A letter from the Attorney General to Auditor DiZoglio repeated the same language of the constitution, without mention of the election's certification. Even more clear, Secretary of State Bill Galvin’s official [ballot question guide](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319882/516273329/-768317615?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377) for this cycle states that approved ballot questions would take effect *December 5th, 2024*. In another section, the guide clarifies that “the courts have not definitively decided” whether the constitution means 30 days after the election date, or after certification. This acknowledged some ambiguity but is far from a definitive support of the legislature's position.

However, following our press conference, Secretary Galvin suddenly definitively backed the legislature’s interpretation that the 30 day clock starts at certification, calling the idea that the law might enter into effect on Dec. 5th “[ridiculous](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319883/516273330/1858558995?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377).” “Ridiculous”–  to read the constitution plainly, and believe the information in the Secretary of State’s own ballot guide! Secretary Galvin has been an ally of transparency in the past, including backing efforts for Public Records Law. On this issue, sounds like someone got a call from legislative leadership to get in line! 

One reporter at the press conference asked the question: well, what’s the harm in waiting for January 3rd to pursue the audit? I think the question should be turned to legislative leaders: if they intend to fully comply, why insist upon a technicality in order to delay the audit a month? Alone, this action might not raise eyebrows. But taken within the context of the legislature’s continued resistance to the audit, this last step– promoting their own interpretation of the language of the constitution to delay the will of the voters– is highly dubious. 

Look– we knew that the legislature would fight this audit tooth and nail. But they’re getting creative! And don’t forget - you can join us tomorrow to ask Auditor DiZoglio about it yourself. 

**Clock ticking on remaining priority bills** 

It’s no secret that the end of session this year was chaotic. Negotiations on July 31, 2024 lasted more than 24 hours– and ended with a whimper, as several major priority bills [remained unfinished](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319884/516273331/-438229207?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377)by the end of formal sessions. Since, legislative leadership has touted their ability to get these remaining bills across the finish line. This included the new liquor licenses for Boston, updates to MA foster care laws, the climate omnibus bill, and– most recently– the economic development bill. 

Despite the late-session progress on these priorities (for better or for worse), there are still a few remaining bills awaiting action. One of these is Mayor Wu’s home rule petition for a shift in the allocation of Boston’s tax burden. This has seen a relentless back and forth with Mayor Wu and leaders in the House and Senate. 

As a reminder, this bill concerns a home rule petition for Boston’s property tax system. As we’ve [discussed](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319885/516273332/-28268084?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377) before, our state legislature is famously sticky with home rule petitions– [reluctant](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319886/516273333/-1792558886?utm_medium=&emci=880b4135-bb6b-ef11-991a-6045bdd9e096&emdi=ded06aab-3a6d-ef11-991a-6045bdd9e096&ceid=21555100&&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=) to give up power to municipalities that are reserved by-right in other states. This particular bill attempts to make a temporary exception to state law to prevent automatic dramatic tax hikes on residential property in Boston. 

This bill gets into the weeds of tax policy a bit, but [this article from WBUR](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319887/516273334/-687460719?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377) explains it pretty well. It’s been controversial with business leaders, because it proposes a temporary hike in the tax on commercial properties in order to ease pressure on Boston residents. Mayor Wu hammered out a compromise with these business leaders in October. 

The new compromise bill [passed the House](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319888/516273335/1505443635?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377) two weeks ago, on a voice vote. It’s been held up in the Senate ever since, most recently by a single senator. Reminder: when operating in low-attendance informal sessions, the dissent of a single member present is enough to block a bill’s passage. 

This past week, Senator Nick Collins of Boston blocked the property tax shift for the [second time](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319889/516273336/2089873959?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377), citing new data from the city that raises questions about the bill’s necessity. Also in play: the [record windfalls of campaign donations Sen. Collins recieved from real estate and business interests](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319890/516273337/-1854137381?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377) in October and November, totaling more than $30,000. Hmmmm. 

The clock is ticking on this bill: the Boston City Council must set tax rates at its upcoming meeting on Wednesday. And needless to say, there are only a few weeks until the official end of the session, once 2024 itself draws to a close. 

Also awaiting action is a substance abuse disorder bill that aims to tackle the opioid crisis in Massachusetts, which claimed the lives of [2,125 MA residents last year](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319891/516273338/-1323372016?utm_medium=&emci=13675d6f-9477-ef11-991a-6045bdee6681&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid=%7B%7BContactsEmailID%7D%7D&&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=).

Advocates are continuing to [rally for action](https://click.everyaction.com/k/98319892/516273339/733257219?utm_medium=&nvep=ew0KICAiVGVuYW50VXJpIjogIm5ncHZhbjovL3Zhbi9FQS9FQTAwNy8xLzkwMTUxIiwNCiAgIkRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvblVuaXF1ZUlkIjogIjcwZjM0NTU1LWFhYjQtZWYxMS04OGQwLTAwMGQzYTlkNTg0MCIsDQogICJFbWFpbEFkZHJlc3MiOiAic2NvdGlhLmhpbGxlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSINCn0%3D&hmac=44vRJYjMKdc8FS6_pr7KaFqzSUZYIh5mTC5jLROD-KQ=&emci=764edb4e-a4b4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&emdi=70f34555-aab4-ef11-88d0-000d3a9d5840&ceid=15186377). If the legislature allows the clock to run out on this legislation, victims and advocates will have to wait for bills to be re-introduced in the new legislative session and passed through the full process before seeing policy action from the state.

## Take Action

**Take action to Defend Question 1!**

Last week, legislators approved a rules change that seems intended to serve as a watered-down version of Question 1, which voters approved by a margin of 72%-28%. Leadership described this rules change, which would give the auditor the ability to appoint the private firm who completes the legislature's financial audits, as an attempt to "acknowledge" the will of the voters. We need all hands on deck to protect the People's Audit from this backsliding. Tell your rep: no acknowledgement but compliance. We demand a full legislative audit.

Thanks for reading! Hope to see many of you in Quincy tomorrow. If not, stay warm, stay bundled, and stay vigilantly skeptical of MA power structures!
