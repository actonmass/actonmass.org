<p>In Massachusetts, it is exceptionally hard to get a recorded vote when bills are voted on by the full House. When comparable states only require 1 to 5 Reps to stand to get a recorded vote on the floor, <strong>Massachusetts requires a whopping 16 Reps or 10% of the legislature.</strong></p>

<p>Getting 16 Reps to coordinate is hard, and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xflRK0RWOZ4&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_n0A-ifVjLenrEL7ESW-xTAic0k15Z105jABLurmvfcYJxqTL9asZ4fE8Pomal8RHVLNzw">presents a challenge to Reps who want to get votes on the record</a>. This is why Massachusetts records so few meaningful votes. And when we do, it’s almost always unanimous or straight down the party line. </p>

<p>Why does it matter if we record votes?  Isn’t the legislature passing amazing progressive legislation all the time?</p>

<p>No. When votes aren’t made public, it leads to a disconnect between what voters want and what our government does.</p>

<p>In 2018, when the House raised the minimum wage to $15/hour, they also removed retail workers’ time-and-a-half pay on Sundays and Holidays.  Many retail workers depend on that time-and-a-half pay to make ends meet, and so the law didn’t make a meaningful difference in their take home pay. </p>

<p>There was an amendment to save time-and-a-half, but because it didn’t get a recorded vote, you don’t know who was on your side or not.  We don’t even know how close it was! Had there been a recorded vote on the issue it’s likely many Reps would have opposed ending time-and-a-half. But without a roll call, it’s easy for Reps to claim they individually opposed the change without having to take a stand in public.</p>

<p>Also, in 2018, during the Criminal Justice Reform debate, the House added a new mandatory minimum sentence into the bill without a recorded vote. At a time when criminal justice advocates were seeking to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/5-charts-show-mandatory-minimum-sentences-dont-work?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_n0A-ifVjLenrEL7ESW-xTAic0k15Z105jABLurmvfcYJxqTL9asZ4fE8Pomal8RHVLNzw">remove <em>all</em> mandatory minimums because they don’t work</a>, Massachusetts added a new one that Republicans were pushing for. It’s hard to believe the amendment would have passed if Reps were on the record, and that’s precisely why it was passed without a recorded vote.</p>

<h2 id="democrats-arent-all-the-same-and-we-deserve-to-know-which-ones-are-fighting-for-our-issues"><strong>Democrats aren’t all the same and we deserve to know which ones are fighting for our issues</strong></h2>

<p>We know among Democrats there’s a wide range of views on important issues. But in terms of recorded votes, we rarely get to see any difference between the <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2015/07/state_house_bills_seek_to_up_p.html?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_n0A-ifVjLenrEL7ESW-xTAic0k15Z105jABLurmvfcYJxqTL9asZ4fE8Pomal8RHVLNzw">most conservative Democrat who called a group of Black Lives Matter protestors “terrorists”</a> and the most progressive Democrats who <a href="https://www.gazettenet.com/workplace-harassment-legislation-30576330?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_n0A-ifVjLenrEL7ESW-xTAic0k15Z105jABLurmvfcYJxqTL9asZ4fE8Pomal8RHVLNzw">stood up to their colleagues to file a bill addressing sexual harassment in the State House</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there’s no way for the public to make any distinction between conservative and progressive Democrats because there are so few recorded votes. As a result, almost everything before a bill becomes law is decided behind closed doors. </p>

<h2 id="we-can-get-more-recorded-votes-if-more-reps-stand-for-roll-call"><strong>We can get more recorded votes if more reps stand for roll call</strong></h2>

<p>As of now, 12 Reps are committed to standing for roll call on bills they have co-sponsored. Those 12 Reps are committed to getting more recorded votes on issues we all care about but they need your help. Without 4 more Reps standing with them, they can’t get a roll call because we need 16. Join the hundreds of other activists and voters who organized constituent meetings with their Reps to demand they tell us how they vote.</p>
