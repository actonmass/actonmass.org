We’re three and a half weeks into the Legislature’s seven-week holiday recess, and exactly three weeks away from 2022 (but who’s counting?). Unlike [last week’s](https://actonmass.org/post/2021/12/06/12-04-21-saturday-scoop-6-reps-4-billion?utm_medium=&emci=fb95f888-9f5a-ec11-94f6-0050f2e65e9b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) ARPA-induced hubbub, this week was quiet and uneventful–much more typical of a recess. Let’s take a peek at what was bubbling under the surface.

**State House Scoop**

**Baker to take action on ARPA bill by Monday**

Governor Baker has until Monday to take formal action on the $4 billion American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”) spending bill passed by the legislature during an informal session last week. While the governor will almost certainly sign the bill (he has been [vocally critical](https://twitter.com/act_on_mass/status/1461407298312720390?utm_medium=&emci=fb95f888-9f5a-ec11-94f6-0050f2e65e9b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) of the legislature for not passing this bill sooner) he might veto specific line items.

**Vote by mail expires on Wednesday, 12/15**

Voting options put into place at the beginning of the pandemic, including vote by mail and early voting, will expire this coming Wednesday. This will have immediate consequences for special elections and local elections this spring. Unless the State House takes action, this could significantly reduce turnout in the midterm election next fall. Of course, when it becomes harder to vote, low-income communities, communities of color, and young people are affected the most. 

**Don’t forget about the VOTES Act**

With the end of vote by mail upon us, it’s no wonder advocates are [renewing their calls](https://www.masslive.com/politics/2021/12/pushing-for-equity-and-election-reform-massachusetts-activists-urge-lawmakers-to-approve-same-day-voter-registration.html?utm_medium=&emci=fb95f888-9f5a-ec11-94f6-0050f2e65e9b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) for the House to vote on the VOTES Act - a bill that would codify into law a host of voting options and protections, including mail-in ballots, early voting, protections for eligible incarcerated voters, and same-day voter registration. The Senate passed this bill in early October, nearly unanimously. The House hasn’t made any suggestion that it will even bring it to a vote. The third rail in the bill is likely same-day voter registration - a policy the House has voted down in the past. 

It’s estimated that same-day voter registration would increase voter turnout in Massachusetts by as much as 10%. That might sound amazing to you and me, but not to everyone. Once in office, elected officials of all kinds have an interest in keeping the electorate as similar as possible to the one that elected them in order to improve their odds of reelection.

**Ask your rep to push for The VOTES Act**

Since it’s on the brain, why not take a moment today to contact your rep about The VOTES Act! If they aren’t a cosponsor, ask them to become a cosponsor. If they already are, ask them to tell Speaker Mariano to bring it to a vote on the floor.

**And last, a not-so-fun-fact to kick off your weekend**

According to new numbers from the Boston Women's Workforce Council, women in the greater Boston area earn [70 cents](https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/12/09/gender-wage-gap-income-pay?utm_medium=&emci=fb95f888-9f5a-ec11-94f6-0050f2e65e9b&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) for every dollar men earn. 

**I’m just gonna leave this bonus fact right here**

Every Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives has been a white man.
