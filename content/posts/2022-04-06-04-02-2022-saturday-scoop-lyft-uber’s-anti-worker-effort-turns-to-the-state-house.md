You know what they say: April showers bring May flowers. And in the Massachusetts Legislature, April hearings bring May budgets (although I must admit, it isn’t nearly as catchy). 

House Ways & Means is currently working on their version of Baker’s annual budget, which will likely be released in the next few weeks. Unlike years past where constituents had opportunities to publicly testify, Ways & Means quietly eliminated the public testimony portion of the budget hearings over the last few weeks. Constituents could only submit [only written testimony](https://malegislature.gov/Events/Hearings/Detail/4250?utm_medium=&emci=5e40bead-a7b2-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) about what they believe should be included in the biggest bill of the session.

Committee hearings where advocates are able to testify publicly, and en masse, are a crucial venue for public pressure and effective activism. The House didn’t explain why they eliminated the option to testify at hearings, although I'd be very interested in what they would have to say.



## **State House Scoop**

**Lyft and Uber bring their anti-worker battle to the legislature**When big corporations want to pass legislation in states, and do so quickly, they use a [time-tested](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/06/08/massachusetts-teachers-union-agrees-give-many-seniority-rights/GB6B5YhIcriROeDLtULLRI/story.html?utm_medium=&emci=5e40bead-a7b2-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) strategy: threaten to run a ballot question backed by nearly endless money, or negotiate a compromise position with the legislature. This dynamic is currently playing out in Massachusetts with the Lyft and Uber-backed effort to classify their drivers as contractors, denying them the protections and benefits of full employees.

Representatives of the group pushing for the anti-worker measure [testified](https://www.wcvb.com/article/app-drivers-companies-politicians-go-head-to-head-on-rideshare-ballot-measure/39589477?utm_medium=&emci=5e40bead-a7b2-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}#) before the legislature this week, claiming that their legislation was in the best interest of their drivers. (Corporations always spend $18 million to pass legislation out of the kindness of their hearts.) With the referendum currently poised to be on November ballots, it’s unclear whether the legislature will decide to make concessions or leave it to the ballot box.

**Commission releases report on “Future of Work” in Massachusetts**\
Work from home and hybrid work are [here to stay](https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2022/03/post-covid-recovery-massachusetts-must-invest-in-housing-child-care-transit-new-report-finds.html?utm_medium=&emci=5e40bead-a7b2-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}), according to the [report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bfeb5489f877013da900c61/t/6241cbeed836906d13d2e4dd/1648479254920/futureofworkreport.pdf?utm_medium=&emci=5e40bead-a7b2-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) released on Tuesday. This will have ripple effects throughout the state in terms of transportation, childcare, eldercare, and housing. The report also found that women and minority groups in particular face increasing hurdles to employment in the wake of Covid-19.

**House passes funding for road repair, doesn’t change outdated formula**\
On Wednesday the House [passed](https://www.wwlp.com/news/state-politics/house-broadens-road-repair-borrowing-bill-with-other-funding/?utm_medium=&emci=5e40bead-a7b2-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) a total of $350 million in funding for road and bridge repairs. $200 million of the funds is through “Chapter 90” – a program through which the state can allocate transportation funding to cities and towns. The problem with Chapter 90: its funding formula has not been updated in *50 years*. This old formula means rural areas with low populations get the short end of the stick. Plus, experts say $200 million isn’t nearly enough: “If Chapter 90 remains at $200 million for fiscal 2023, the real (inflation-adjusted) level of state support for local road projects would drop by 42.6% percent” since 2012. 

**Massachusetts Commission on LGBTQ Youth holds rally on State House steps**\
In honor of Trans Day of Visibility, the Massachusetts Commission on LGBTQ Youth rallied on the State House steps on Thursday in solidarity with trans and non-binary youth in states where anti-LGBTQ legislation has been passed. Key speakers included legislative leaders and the Executive Director of [Boston Alliance of LGBTQ+ Youth](https://www.bagly.org/?utm_medium=&emci=5e40bead-a7b2-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) Grace Sterling Stowell. The commission also called on the MA State House to pass a bill that provides a gender-neutral option on state documents and identification ([H3126](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H3126?utm_medium=&emci=5e40bead-a7b2-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}})).

## **And last, a not-so-fun-fact to kick off your weekend**

In theory, joint committees have a massive and critical role in the legislative process: they review bills after being filed, meet in executive session to deliberate on and redraft bills, and ultimately vote on which bills to advance to the next step. Unfortunately, none of this actually happens in Massachusetts. Other than the public hearings (where legislators don’t meaningfully participate and often don’t attend), committees do not meet to discuss their bills. Instead of holding executive sessions, committee chairs are in charge of redrafts and conduct informal votes via email – a key loophole that allows them to avoid having to make their votes public.

That’s it for this week! Enjoy these fickle early days of spring.
