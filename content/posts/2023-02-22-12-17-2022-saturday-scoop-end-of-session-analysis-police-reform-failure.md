The sun is setting at 4:13pm, yuletide carols are in the air, and the race to firm up New Year’s Eve plans is on. This can only mean one thing: we’re approaching the very last days of the 192nd legislative session.

The legislature has mere days left to pass bills before gaveling in the new session on 1/6, and they’ve given no indication that they plan on taking last minute action on any of the bills Baker vetoed, like the 5-year prison construction moratorium or no-cost calls for loved ones of incarcerated individuals. 

Yes, it’s infuriating to see the legislature do so little with their incredible power, especially with so much on the line. But this past session is also a testament to how, with concerted organizing and pressure, we *can* win progressive victories. That’s how we passed (and defended on the ballot!) the [Work and Family Mobility Act](https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/02/03/undocumented-immigrants-drivers-licenses-bill-massachusetts?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}), [banning child marriage](https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/07/26/massachusetts-marrriage-minimum-age-bill?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}), and the [Fair Share Amendment](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/26/metro/this-is-once-generation-opportunity-local-teachers-canvass-fair-share-amendment/?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}), the result of grassroots campaigns that spanned years or even decades. 

Let me be clear: you should not have to organize for 20 years to get the MA legislature to implement immigrant protections that [16 other states plus Puerto Rico and D.C.](https://miracoalition.org/get-involved/drivers-licenses/?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) already have. That’s exactly why we so desperately need to reform the state house to combat the culture of careerism and inaction that has made our state government so much slower and more conservative than the people it serves.

But hey, we’re [working on it](https://secure.everyaction.com/oITinRw4Ck-JRO3NetrRFA2?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}). In the meantime, the path forward for progressive victories is clear: organize, organize, organize. The state house doesn’t pass bold change willingly. We must make it clear that we won’t accept anything less.

Here’s to more calls and emails to reps, grassroots lobby meetings, letters to the editor, petitions, phonebanks, and every other act of democracy in 2023. May your canvasses be merry and bright! 

For the last time in 2022, let’s dive in.

## **State House Scoop**

**Green Line Extension Medford branch opens**

Great news for Somervillians and transit-enthusiasts alike: the Medford branch of the long-awaited MBTA Green Line Extension project [opened this past Monday](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/12/12/its-just-a-huge-accomplishment-green-line-extension-opens-with-fanfare-festivities?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}). Hoards of excited commuters, families, students, and elected officials awoke bright and early to hop on the first ride at 5am. But Monday’s revelry was tempered by a harsh and present reality: landlords have been using the added transit stops as an excuse to jack up rents in Somerville, already suffering an affordable housing crisis. As one housing activist [noted](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/12/12/its-just-a-huge-accomplishment-green-line-extension-opens-with-fanfare-festivities?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}), the same communities that stand to benefit the most from public transportation are the ones who will likely be priced out because of it. Hopefully the housing crisis will be addressed quicker than the construction of the Green Line extension, which was first pitched a century ago.

**Two razor-thin state rep races called for Democrats**

5 weeks and two recounts later, two general election state rep races were [finally called](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/massachusetts-playbook/2022/12/09/every-vote-counts-00073212?nname=massachusetts-playbook&nid=0000014f-704c-d54c-a1ff-fb6da68f0000&nrid=ba098114-c7c0-43d4-b4f6-29d15830e3c5&nlid=630384&utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) this week. Democrat Margaret Scarsdale beat her Republican opponent Andrew Shepherd by just seven votes to become the next representative for the 1st Middlesex district. And seven votes looks like a landslide compared to the nail-biter in the 2nd Essex where Democrat Kristin Kassner beat incumbent Republican Lenny Mira by *a single vote*. It hardly needs to be said but I’ll say it anyway: your vote makes a big difference, and volunteering makes a *huge* difference. It’s conceivable that if Kassner had one fewer canvassing shifts, she wouldn’t have gotten that one extra vote. 

**New police recertification process aimed at accountability recertified officers with confirmed history of violence**

In response to police brutality and ensuing Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, the Massachusetts legislature passed a sweeping police reform bill that same year. Shockingly (read: not shockingly) the bill was passed largely in secret and was opposed by many racial justice advocates for not going nearly far enough. One provision created a new commission to establish police certification standards that would hold abusive and violent officers accountable. Sounds pretty good, right?

This past week, the first batch of recertifications were [released to the public](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2022/12/13/officers-with-past-complaints-recertified-by-state-police-commission-amid-first-batch-of-names-released?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}). Among the list of re-certified officers were 18 who had undergone internal investigations, 10 of whom had complaints sustained for “use of force,” “conduct unbecoming” and “\[non-]conformance to laws.” Several of the recertified officers had *repeated* complaints, including Boston Captain John Danilecki, a man once called “[the avatar of cop violence in Boston](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/06/24/metro/midst-police-brutality-protests-boston-officer-becomes-symbol-activists-outrage/?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}})” by the Globe. Created in the name of “police reform,” this commission didn’t even decertify police officers who are known to be violent and abusive. This is another very tangible consequence of passing bills behind closed doors and without the input of the people most impacted by policy. 

**Legislator farewell speeches**

As is tradition on Beacon Hill, lawmakers who won’t be returning for the next session made [farewell speeches](https://www.wwlp.com/news/state-politics/lawmakers-open-up-while-closing-out-careers/?utm_medium=&emci=62c3c28f-3d7e-ed11-9d7a-000d3a9eb913&emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}) on the floor this week. Among the speeches were some powerful statements rebuking the status quo on Beacon hill; Rep. Tami Gouveia reiterated her support for the State House staffer’s union and called out the legislature’s failure to act on same day registration and no-cost calls. Sen. Sonia Chang Diaz spoke bravely about the tradeoff she made between pursuing a landmark education funding bill and loyalty to Senate leadership–a decision that she said cost her "political safety, a committee chairmanship, my position in leadership, probably many thousands of dollars in pension benefits.” 

In addition to stirring remarks about power and public service were some bizarre pieces of Beacon Hill lore. Rep. Paul Tucker, for example, used his farewell speech to tell a wacky anecdote about the time he went to a legislator's conference in Arkansas with his colleague Rep. Joseph McGonagle. I won’t spoil it for you, but to answer your question: yes, it involves lawn flamingos.
