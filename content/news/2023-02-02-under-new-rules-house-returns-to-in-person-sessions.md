extract: Act on Mass said publishing how committee members vote on bills is
  “standard practice in a majority of other states as well as in the
  Massachusetts State Senate.” The group said an “opaque committee process” in
  the House, which controls joint committees by virtue of having more reps on
  those panels than senators, is “key to the concentration of power on Beacon
  Hill.” The group further claims that the current setup enables House Democrats
  to “kill progressive legislation with little explanation as to why.”
