extract: “Right now we see the committee process being used as a rubber stamp
  for leadership’s agenda–not as a real, democratic body. When legislators get
  to vote in secret, they are incentivised to vote with leadership while
  avoiding the scrutiny of their constituents” said Ransden. “When voters head
  to the ballot box and decide to reelect their incumbent, they’re doing so only
  knowing a fraction of their actual voting record. How are we supposed to hold
  our elected officials accountable to our beliefs and values if we can’t see
  how they’re voting?”
