extract: "**Massachusetts ranked among the bottom 10 state legislatures** for
  the number of laws enacted in the 2021-2022 session, with 110 total. Just 5.8
  percent of bills filed at the State House eventually became law — the fourth
  lowest rate nationally behind Minnesota, New Jersey and Missouri. Bay State
  senators and representatives this year introduced 6,691 bills — 80 percent
  fewer than in the last session, a recent study found."
