  "﻿It’s hard to believe that Massachusetts, which prides itself on its place in
  American history as one of the leading colonies in the fight for independence
  and democracy, would have such a poor record when it comes to transparency in
  government. The public’s right to know something as basic as how a state
  representative votes in one of the 30 committees in the House shouldn’t even
  be in question.


  Fortunately, the nonprofit organization Act on Mass — a coalition of progressive groups and unions — is working to pry open the secretive Statehouse, including not just legislators, the governor and the courts, but also law enforcement agencies."
