extract: '"At its core, this issue is, or should be, above politics. It’s about
  prioritizing equipping voters to hold politicians accountable over keeping
  those politicians’ machinations secret. We urge the Berkshire delegation and
  all members of the state House of Representatives to affirm these priorities
  by voting to make the House a more transparent institution."'
