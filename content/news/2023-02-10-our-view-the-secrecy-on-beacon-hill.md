  When your state representative votes, you would expect that vote to be
  recorded, right?


  Not in Massachusetts.


  Last week while the House was deciding on its rules for the session that began last month, representatives rejected two amendments to make all committee votes public information. To make matters worse, no votes were recorded on the decision.


  That means that Attleboro area voters have no idea how the official elected to represent them on Beacon Hill stands on the issue. They may say they are for transparency in government, but do they back up their words?
