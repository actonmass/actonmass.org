extract: "\"You have the vast majority of legislators knowing for sure that
  they're going to be reelected,\" said Erin Leahy, the executive director of
  Act on Mass, a progressive group that advocates for rules reform in the
  Legislature. \"They're going to sail to reelection without having to even run
  another campaign, and that brings about a really problematic dynamic where
  reps and senators aren't really accountable to their constituents. In theory,
  a healthy, representative democracy means voters have a choice in who
  represents them.\""
