extract: “This favorable report is a sign that the State House is feeling the
  pressure of our movement,” said Brenna Ransden, organizing director of Act on
  Mass. “And it’s not just constituents who stand to benefit from increased
  government transparency; this bill is also about empowering rank-and-file
  lawmakers to be the strongest possible advocates for their legislation. We
  look forward to working with allies inside and outside the building to get
  this critical bill across the finish line.”
