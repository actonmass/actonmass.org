  “We really tried to target leadership districts this time around, because we
  know they

  hold disproportionate power over the rest of the state Legislature,” said Erin Leahy, Act on Mass’ executive director. “We don’t think that’s right, which is why we’re trying to change that system.” Leahy said advocates also targeted open House races to help win support for open meetings and legislative reforms among freshman lawmakers and their new constituencies. “We know there’s a lot of pressure from inside the building, once you get brought into that culture, to go along with leadership,” she said. “We want to set the tone before people even get into that office.”
