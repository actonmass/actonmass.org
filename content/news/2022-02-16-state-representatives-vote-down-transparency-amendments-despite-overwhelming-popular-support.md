extract: "\"'This is about holding ourselves accountable to the public, making
  our work transparent and accessible to all, and honoring and recognizing the
  thoughtfulness, hard work, creativity, and ingenuity of the bills that come
  before us by having a public vote in every legislative session for each bill,'
  said freshman representative Erika Uyterhoeven in a floor speech during debate
  for \\[public committee votes].\""
