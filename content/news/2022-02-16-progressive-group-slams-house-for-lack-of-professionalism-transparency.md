extract: "\"Ella McDonald of Act on Mass said progressive groups have come to
  understand the importance of transparency in areas like committee votes. 'If
  we can’t see how our legislators are voting, we can’t hold them accountable to
  any of issue we care about, and it’s causing lack of action on nearly every
  progressive issue,' she said.\""
