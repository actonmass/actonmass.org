extract: "[The tax package](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H3770) was never
  voted on by the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, making a mockery of
  the [public hearing that committee held on March
  28.](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/J26/Hearings) It contained a
  tax cut for corporations that was not even on the agenda at that hearing. The
  tax cut, which would cost the state at least $79 million annually, was not in
  Governor Maura Healey’s original proposal or any bill or amendment filed by a
  House member. It came from [a Senate
  bill](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/S1951) filed by a Republican and
  favorable to the [Associated Industries of
  Massachusetts,](https://aimnet.org/advocacy/budget-taxes/) the lobbying arm of
  the state’s big businesses."
