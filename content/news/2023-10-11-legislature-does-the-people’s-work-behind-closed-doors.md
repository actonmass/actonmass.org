extract: The tax package was never voted on by the Legislature’s Revenue
  Committee, making a mockery of the public hearing that committee held on March
  28. It contained a tax cut for corporations that was not even on the agenda at
  that hearing. The tax cut, which would cost the state at least $79 million
  annually, was not in Governor Maura Healey’s original proposal or any bill or
  amendment filed by a House member. It came from a Senate bill filed by a
  Republican and favorable to the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the
  lobbying arm of the state’s big businesses.
