extract: "\"The Boston City Council voted unanimously on Wednesday to pass a
  resolution 'urging action in the Massachusetts Legislature to uphold the
  values of transparency and accessibility to the peopleâ€™s business.' Moulton, a
  Salem resident who represents the 6th Congressional District, wrote in a July
  14 tweet that 'government works for the people' as he shared a Boston Globe
  editorial condemning the House for rejecting the changes.\""
