extract: '"Could this be the year Massachusetts state representatives open
  themselves up to more scrutiny? Constituents seeking an early hint could look
  to a recent meeting of the legislative committee debating just that — when
  lawmakers voted to conduct discussions about their internal transparency rules
  out of the view of the press and public."'
