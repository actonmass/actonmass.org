extract: Executive Director of Act on Mass, Erin Leahy, told 22News, “Having
  committee votes be public, not only is that a great way to just hold our Reps
  accountable for representing the views of their constituents, it’s also a
  great way to make sure that they’re actually going through the steps of our
  democratic process as they should be.”
