extract: Every now and then, the Massachusetts Legislature sends the rest of us
  a reminder that it is, for better or worse, an alternate dimension — one
  governed by its own logic and sensibilities, and whose occupants aren't overly
  interested in squaring their own worldview with everyone else's.
