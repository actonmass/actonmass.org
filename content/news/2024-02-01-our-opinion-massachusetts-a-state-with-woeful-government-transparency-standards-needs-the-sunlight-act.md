extract: These are common-sense and long overdue upgrades to the basic
  mechanisms of public accountability in a state with a disappointing posture
  and record on governmental secrecy. We arenâ€™t alone in that sentiment.
  Transparency advocates like Act on Mass have been pushing for many of the
  principles in this bill for a long time, and they deserve credit for keeping
  this fight up amid years of entrenched political resistance.
