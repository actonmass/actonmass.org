extract: “Far too often legislators lose touch with their constituents once
  elected and conform to the pernicious culture of Beacon Hill’s establishment.
  While the carrots and sticks offered by the speaker and House leadership are
  many, I have no doubt in my mind that Raul, Jack, and Vivian will put the
  needs and values of their communities above insider politics."
