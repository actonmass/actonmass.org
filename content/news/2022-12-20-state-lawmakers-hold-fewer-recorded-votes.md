  Erin Leahy, executive director of the group Act on Mass., said it is
  “disappointing” to see the state Legislature taking fewer votes on the record.


  “When the Legislature conducts the public’s business behind closed doors, our democracy suffers,” she said. “How are everyday people supposed to engage with the lawmaking process when so few votes are recorded for them to see? How can constituents hold their elected officials accountable when they can’t see how they’re voting on issues that affect their lives?”
