extract: Act on Mass’s initial goals are fairly simple – disclose how lawmakers
  vote in committee, make bills public 72 hours prior to a vote, and hold more
  roll calls. She said the use of consolidated amendments, where amendments are
  lumped together and voted on as a package, illustrate the Legislature’s lack

  public eye. It happens behind closed doors,” Uyterhoeven said. “What is on
  display for the public to view is strictly performative politics.”
