extract: The biennial bill-reporting deadline came and went last week, but an
  11-month legislative disagreement means the public may never know how their
  representatives and senators voted in deliberations over whether proposals
  should advance or fall short. The House and Senate each supported some form of
  pulling back the curtain on how panels vote, but Democrats couldnâ€™t agree on a
  reform plan and existing legislative rules do not require joint committees to
  publish any breakdown of where members stand on bills they report.
