  According to Hecht, who’s on the steering committee of the *Coalition to
  Reform our Legislature*, the problem starts at the top. Power is concentrated
  among a small group of leaders — the House speaker, Senate president and their
  respective Ways and Means chairs — which means rank-and-file members and, yes,
  even the governor, have to “tread carefully,” he said.


  “Their budget priorities, their bills, are all ultimately dependent on whether those two or three people at the top look favorably on them or not,” Hecht said.
