extract: " The usual State House acoustic is the sound of silence — and that
  silence is deafening. Where reporters, advocates, and lobbyists once mingled
  in the hallways during the afternoons and evenings — and sometimes late into
  the night — as legislators debated, the marble halls are now empty. These
  days, virtually everything by way of policy comes from the top down. Power is
  essentially vested in four offices: that of the Senate president, House
  speaker, and the two [Ways and Means
  Committee ](https://ballotpedia.org/Ways_and_Means_Committee,_Massachusetts_H\
  ouse_of_Representatives)chairmen or chairwomen, who essentially function as
  the political and policy enforcers in each chamber."
