extract: “This is a perfect illustration of why we so desperately need this
  reform in the first place. The irony of an amendment meant to make more of our
  legislator’s votes visible to the public dying with an unrecorded vote is not
  lost on us,” Erin Leahy, executive director of Act on Mass, said in a
  statement Thursday morning. “As a good governance watchdog, our goal at Act on
  Mass is to shine a light on the canyon between what voters want and believe
  and what their state house is doing. The legislature’s refusal to publish
  committee votes is a perfect example of this disconnect that is, frankly,
  anti-democratic.”
