  The facts paint a disturbing
  picture. [Study](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2014-04-20/mass-legislature-among-states-that-pass-the-fewest-bills) after [study](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/08/08/metro/infighting-obfuscation-delay-chaotic-end-massachusetts-legislative-session/) finds
  that Massachusetts has one of the least efficient, least productive state
  governments in the United States.


  By the end of May, only 10 bills had been [passed](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/05/29/metro/massachusetts-has-passed-just-10-laws-this-year-fewest-open-legislative-session-decades-its-sign-times/) by our elected officials, and most of those bills were for ultra-specific matters like nixing the age limit for a Boston police officer.


  If you’re wondering why our lawmakers are so lacking in urgency and initiative, it’s hard to say, because Massachusetts also has one of the least transparent state governments in the nation.
