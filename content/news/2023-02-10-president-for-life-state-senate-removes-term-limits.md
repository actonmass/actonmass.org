  According to Leahy, the change will allow a long-serving president to set the
  agenda for lawmaking in the state with few speaking in opposition.


  “Once leadership makes a decision, the members tend to fall in line. The culture of hierarchy and retaliation was on full display during this vote; only three Democrats were courageous enough to vote against this power grab, and none spoke on the floor in opposition. Let’s be clear: term limits aren’t about any one senate president,” she said.


  “This is about sharing power. This is about ensuring that, through their elected officials, everyday people are able to have a voice in their government."
