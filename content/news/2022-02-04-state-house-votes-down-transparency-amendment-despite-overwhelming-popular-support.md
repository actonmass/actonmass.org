extract: "\"'It’s shocking that many of the arguments against the amendment
  blamed constituents for our lack of understanding of how the State House
  functions when that’s precisely what we are asking for: to stop being shut out

  representatives care more about power than their constituents,' said Ryan
  Daulton, a Campaign Manager with Act on Mass.\""
