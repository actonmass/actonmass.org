  Leahy said the audit is long overdue, especially with the Massachusetts Senate
  recently voting to remove term limits for its President, and the House
  continuing to keep all committee votes out of public view.


  "The truth of the matter is only a few people in the State House are deciding which bills will pass and which bills will not pass. These are happening in closed room decisions, not really on the floor with vigorous debate and with limited input from the public and unfortunately, very little accountability to the public."
