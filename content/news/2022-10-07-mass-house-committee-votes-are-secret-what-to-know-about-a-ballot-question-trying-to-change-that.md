extract: "\"Advocacy group Act on Mass has led the campaign to include this
  question on the ballot in certain districts. Massachusetts is largely
  considered one of the most opaque governments in the country — it's the only
  state in which the Legislature, courts, and governor's office all claim to be
  exempt from public records laws. This ballot question is part of the
  nonprofit's long-term strategy to change that.\""
