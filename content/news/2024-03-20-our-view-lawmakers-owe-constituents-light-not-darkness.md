extract: '"Consider all the major pieces of legislation lawmakers have dealt
  with in recent years: tax reform, climate change, election reform,
  transportation, sports betting, mental health treatment funding, veterans
  affairs. Now ask yourself if you know how your local lawmakers voted on them.
  Well, thereâ€™s no way of knowing."'
