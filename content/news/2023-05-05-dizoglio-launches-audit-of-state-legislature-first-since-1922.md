extract: Groups that have pushed for more transparency on Beacon Hill welcomed
  DiZoglio’s audit, saying a review of the legislative process is long overdue.
  “Not only is this necessary, but it’s very timely,” Erin Leahy, executive
  director of Act on Mass, a coalition of progressive groups and unions. “The
  Massachusetts Legislature is consistently ranked as one of the least
  transparent in the country, and that has deep and material consequences for
  the strength of our democracy.”
