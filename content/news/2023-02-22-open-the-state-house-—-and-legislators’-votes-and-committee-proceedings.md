extract: ...House leaders do not want committees and their members to be too
  influential in shaping legislation. In the time between when bills leave
  committee and when they hit the floor, they go behind closed doors where they
  are reviewed, rewritten, or deep-sixed by only a handful of legislative
  leaders. Since all of this occurs largely outside public view, with no
  hearings and no public record, it’s impossible to know who else weighs in.
  This is favorable terrain for savvy insiders, including lobbyists, who are
  adept at using connections and campaign contributions to get their voices
  heard.
