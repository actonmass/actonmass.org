  four states where the Legislature is exempt from public records law, one of
  only two where the governor is exempt, and the only state in the country where
  the Legislature, the judiciary, and the governor’s office all claim this
  exemption. </p><p>The result of all these exemptions to commonplace good
  governance safeguards is that the bulk of the decision-making on Beacon Hill
  happens behind closed doors, during off-the-record conversations, among a just
  handful of powerful individuals. Without adequate input from or accountability
  to the public, our leaders have little incentive to make bold changes, even
  when they know such changes to be widely popular.</p><p>In fact, advocates and

  into why this bill has been killed, or who among the majority of legislators
  who cosponsor this bill is acting against its progress. As advocates, that
  opacity leaves us with very few levers to pull to effect change. </p><p>And
  it’s not just happening to taboo topics like sex ed. Countless other popular
  bills have met similar fates, including same-day voter registration, ending
  wage theft, and removing archaic language (i.e., slurs) from our

  secretive system. A study by Brown University found that one of the main

  The report notes: “The vast majority of climate-related legislation dies in
  committee, where committee membership is decided by leadership and votes are
  not public.”</p><p>Their number one recommendation for effecting better
  legislative outcomes? Sharply improve transparency, including cataloging and
  archiving testimony submitted to committees and making it available to the
  public, and mandating that all committee votes be transparent and
  public. </p><p>Advocates, including Act on Mass, have been calling for
  commonsense good governance reforms to strengthen our democracy for years. Our
  coalition includes thousands of volunteers across the state and dozens of
  endorsing organizations ranging from local antiracism groups to labor unions.
  Despite the size and breadth of the movement, however, our good governance
  reforms have struggled to gain traction on Beacon Hill, where House leaders
  are known to firmly oppose them.</p><p>Until now, that is. On January 23, An
  Act to Provide Sunlight to State Government (S. 1963), also known as the
  Sunlight Act, received a favorable report from the Joint Committee on Rules,
  surmounting the first and often the steepest hurdle of the legislative
  process. </p><p>This bill, sponsored by longtime transparency champion Sen.
  Jamie Eldridge, would implement a number of urgent transparency reforms
  including requiring all recorded committee votes to be posted on the
  Legislature’s website, requiring that committee hearings be scheduled at least
  a week in advance, making written testimony submitted to committees publicly
  available, and subjecting the governor’s office to the state’s public records
  law. </p><p>These reforms would go a long way towards opening up our
  notoriously secretive state government and make it easier for everyday people
  to have a say in the legislative process that shapes their lives, their
  communities, and their future. By advancing this bill favorably, the Senate
  hints that they agree. </p><p>And why wouldn’t they? As Senate President
  Spilka pointed out during <a

  support of three of these four reforms (public records law for the governor’s
  office being the exception) through the Senate’s proposal for the
  Legislature's joint rules. We cannot thank the Senate enough for leading on
  these issues.</p><p>One other cause for celebration: Last session, the
  Legislature made a number of COVID-era accessibility measures permanent,
  including hybrid committee hearings. This was a huge victory for the public’s
  ability to participate in the committee process. </p><p>We see the reforms in
  the Sunlight Act as the natural next steps. Saving people the drive to Beacon
  Hill is great, but means little if people still have only a few days notice to
  take time off work and prepare their testimony, and have no insight into the
  committee’s decision after the fact.</p><p>The Sunlight Act now sits in Senate
  Ways & Means, the antechamber from which a handful of bills considered urgent
  enough to be prioritized by Senate leadership may be brought to the floor for
  a vote before the end of the session. It is now incumbent upon us to convince
  the Senate that these transparency and accountability measures are about more
  than mere abstract good governance principles — they’re about the very
  foundation of our democracy. </p><p>Whether it’s teenagers receiving medically
  accurate sex ed, increasing access to the ballot, or staving off climate
  disaster, the need for everyday people to have a seat at the table is indeed
  an urgent one.</p><p>Call your senator today to voice your support for the
  Sunlight Act and urge them to bring it to a vote in the Senate this session.
