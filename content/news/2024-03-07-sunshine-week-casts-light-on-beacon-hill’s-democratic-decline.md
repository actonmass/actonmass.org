extract: 2023 was a bad year for good governance on Beacon Hill. The Senate
  eliminated the Senate president’s term limits, Gov. Healey walked back her
  promise to comply with the state’s public records law, and the House shot down
  an amendment that would have made legislative committee votes public without a
  public vote. And that was just February.
