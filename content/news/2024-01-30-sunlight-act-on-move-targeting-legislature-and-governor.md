extract: “We could not be more thrilled to see the Committee move this bill
  forward in the legislative process,” Act on Mass Executive Director Erin Leahy
  said in a statement Wednesday morning. “Transparency is really a democracy
  issue. If you can’t see how your lawmakers are voting or who is influencing
  them, never mind if you don’t have enough notice to testify at a hearing, how
  are you supposed to meaningfully participate in the lawmaking process? The
  Sunlight Act would go a long way toward opening up our state government to the
  voices of everyday people. Today is a great day for our movement.”
