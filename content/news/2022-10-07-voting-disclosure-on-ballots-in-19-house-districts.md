extract: “There are reps — and our intention is for there to be reps — who want
  to take these votes in favor of good governance and transparency issues,”
  Leahy said. “Given a data point that 90 percent of their constituents voted
  for them to do this, instructed them to do this, that can be a really great
  excuse for them to do the right thing if they’re up against the speaker or
  House leadership or their colleagues who don’t want them to vote for this
  amendment. Having this in their back pocket is kind of a shield, a little bit
  of a defense mechanism for them to vote the right way on this issue.”
