extract: '"Raul is the only candidate in this race committed to bringing a
  transparent legislative process to Beacon Hill," AOM spokesperson Erin Leahy
  said in a statement. "The incumbent representative has repeatedly voted
  against making committee votes public and against giving representatives
  enough time to read bills and amendments before voting on them."'
