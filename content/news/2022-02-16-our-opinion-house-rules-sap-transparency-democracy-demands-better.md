extract: '"While that secrecy abounds beyond the House and even the Legislature,
  it is hard to think of a more exemplary affront to democracy than denying Bay
  Staters decent foreknowledge of legislation being teed up and how the
  representatives that they sent to Beacon Hill vote on those bills in the
  critical committee phase."'
