  Erin Leahy, executive director of the progressive group Act on Mass, said she
  believes House Democrats remain opposed to publicizing a full member-by-member
  breakdown of committee votes “because they don’t want committees to play an
  actual, active role in the lawmaking process.”


  “Having a strong show of support for a bill in committee via a positive committee vote can make it hard for leadership to have to explain later why they decided to change a bill or shelve it or not take it on at all,” Leahy said. “And if legislative leaders want a bill to die, they can avoid and diffuse accountability if they are able to hide who voted which way or even how many people voted at all.”
