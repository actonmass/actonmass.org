  Erin Leahy, executive director of the group Act on Mass, which has pressed for
  more transparency in the Legislature, said it was troubling that the Senate
  was considering “sinking down to the House’s level” on term limits.


  “Having one person in that role for an extended period of time — and allowing them to amass more and more power and keeping potential new perspectives at bay — is bad for all of us,” Leahy said.
