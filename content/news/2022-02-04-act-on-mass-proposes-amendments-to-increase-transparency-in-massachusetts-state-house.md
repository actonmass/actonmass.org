  Murphy, a junior, said that without a roll call vote, it’s difficult to know
  which representatives to hold accountable for climate justice bills dying in
  committee. 


  “Not knowing where our reps stand makes it impossible to put pressure on them to work towards climate justice, especially since they can easily say they support something, and then in the back room just go and vote against it,” Murphy said. “We wouldn’t know because there’s no public record of committee votes … unless roll call is demanded.”
