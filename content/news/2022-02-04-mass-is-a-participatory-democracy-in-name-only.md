extract: A little known secret is that state legislators in Massachusetts write
  their own rulebook governing how bills are introduced, debated, and voted on.
  The rules are written every two years at the start of the legislative session
  in January. These rules shield legislators from public scrutiny, making them
  less accountable to voters and undercutting public participation in democracy.
