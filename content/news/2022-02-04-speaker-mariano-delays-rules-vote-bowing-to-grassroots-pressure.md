extract: "\"Miriam Siegel, a constituent from the 5th Middlesex district and
  volunteer with Act on Mass, responds to Marianoâ€™s letter: 'State House
  leadership is attempting to resist a popular movement for rules reform the
  only way they know how: by delaying action, shutting out constituents, and
  disempowering grassroots advocacy organizations. How can we be empowered as
  constituents if we are constantly kept in the dark?'\""
