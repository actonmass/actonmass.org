extract: '"The democratic dysfunction and secrecy of Beacon Hill actively harms
  our ability to pass policy that uplifts the Bay Staters who need it the most.
  The Office of the Auditor exists to find ways to make our government work
  better for the people. Not only should the Auditor audit the Legislature—it
  should be priority #1.”'
