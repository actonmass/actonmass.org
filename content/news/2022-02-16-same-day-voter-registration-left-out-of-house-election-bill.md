extract: "\"Ella McDonald, communications director for Act on Mass, said House
  lawmakers have a vested interest in resisting anything that would boost
  turnout among populations that could challenge their grip on their seats. 'I
  think it's important to look critically at the fact that in a state that has a
  ton of protections for incumbents and one of the lowest rates in the country
  of primary challengers winning elections, it's really telling that we're not
  able to get same-day voter registration,' McDonald said.\""
