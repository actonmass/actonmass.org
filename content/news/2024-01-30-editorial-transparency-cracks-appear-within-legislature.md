  Like the ballot measure, shedding light on the closed shop of the Legislature
  should enlist overwhelming bipartisan support.


  At least that’s how the voters of this state should see it.


  And since they’re the ones who elect their senators and reps, they should insist that they lift the veil of secrecy on Beacon Hill.


  Because one way or another – through a direct vote next November or legislation by their peers – lawmakers eventually will be forced to face the music.
