extract: '"Utility companies and their special interest friends like real estate
  and fossil fuel corporations are not just to blame though. It’s also our state
  government. In “Finding 12: Climate Action is tightly controlled by State
  House committees and leadership,” the report describes the “hierarchy and lack
  of transparency” in the State House as a key barrier to progress."'
