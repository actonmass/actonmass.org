  “Not only is (the audit) necessary, but it is very timely,” Erin Leahy,
  executive director of Act on Mass — a coalition of progressive groups and
  unions — told Statehouse reporter Christian W. Wade. “The Massachusetts
  Legislature is consistently ranked as one of the least transparent in the
  country, and that has deep and material consequences for the strength of our
  democracy.”


  She’s right. The public needs and deserves information about how its business is done, and an audit can help shed light on that process.
