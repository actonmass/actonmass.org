extract: "\"\\[Act on Mass organizer Calla Walsh] tells The New Republic that if
  progressives want to see change in the state, first they have to pull back the

  are for the most part secret. That means that bills will sit in committee for
  years or get sent to study, where they die,' Walsh says.\""
