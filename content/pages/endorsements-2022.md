# 2022 State Representative Endorsements

**It’s no easy task to find candidates who are down the line progressives, have shown they are dedicated to serving their communities, and are willing to fight the status quo at the State House. Another thing these candidates all have in common? They can win. They just need our help to do it. Use the links below to sign up to volunteer for these campaigns.**

<p class="endorsement-quote">I know what is possible when the government opens its doors and engages people in the process of creating policy to improve people’s lives. I did this in partnership with our community on the Brookline Select Board, and as State Rep I will bring that transparency to Beacon Hill.</p>

<p class="endorsement-quote">As one who cares deeply about our democratic institutions, I’m proud to receive Act on Mass’s endorsement which speaks to our campaign’s desire to have a state legislature filled with robust and open debate, not one where all of the major decisions affecting our Commonwealth are hashed out behind closed doors.</p>

<p class="endorsement-quote">I’ve been closely following the work of Act on Mass since 2018 when I first became concerned about our State House and its lack of transparency around the legislative process.

<p class="endorsement-quote">As a community organizer at heart, I know the importance of relationships, transparency, and communication for our movements. Our current legislative process keeps people out and unable to advocate for themselves. I look forward to pushing for more light and making space for people to join up and make change.</p>

<p class="endorsement-quote">We need to provide constituents the tools to hold their Representatives accountable.

<p class="endorsement-quote">Act on Mass’ advocacy taught me so much about how the State House (doesn’t) work. In many ways, they are why I am running— to transform power in our Commonwealth by building up our grassroots democracy. I am so happy to have earned their support in our race and look forward to what we will accomplish together.</p>
