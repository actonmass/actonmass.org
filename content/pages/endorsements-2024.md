# 2024 State Legislative Endorsements

Act on Mass has opened applications for endorsement for the 2024 state legislative election cycle! And for the first time, we will be endorsing in both state representative and state senate races. (Both House and Senate candidates may complete the same questionnaire.)

**Application instructions for candidates:** Applications will be reviewed and endorsements made on a rolling basis. You can find our endorsement questionnaire here. Please make a copy in Google Docs, and send your completed questionnaire to info@actonmass.org. If you have an opponent in your race, upon receipt of your application, we will invite them to apply as well with a 1-week deadline to ensure a fair process. Select applicants will advance to the second and final round of the endorsement process consisting of an interview with Act on Mass staff and/or Board members. Further instructions can be found in the questionnaire document. 

**Information for voters and volunteers:** Keep an eye on this webpage for updates! This is where we will announce our endorsements and provide opportunities to get involved with the candidates campaigns.
