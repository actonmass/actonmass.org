# 2024 State Representative Endorsements

**It’s no easy task to find candidates who are down the line progressives, have shown they are dedicated to serving their communities, and are willing to fight the status quo at the State House. Another thing these candidates all have in common? They can win. They just need our help to do it. Use the links below to sign up to volunteer for these campaigns.**

<p class="endorsement-quote">Act on Mass is a terrific organization helping everyday people decipher the opaque inner workings of the state house. Many people in my community are astounded by what they learn about our state house through Act on Mass’s educational videos, blog, and website. I am proud to receive their endorsement and very much look forward to working together.</p>

### **Application instructions for candidates**

Act on Mass has opened applications for endorsement for the 2024 state legislative election cycle! And for the first time, we will be endorsing in both state representative and state senate races. (Both House and Senate candidates may complete the same questionnaire.) Applications will be reviewed and endorsements made on a rolling basis. **[You can find our endorsement questionnaire here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIkXugrUD8x1EvPYyJrnTavuvFvQ7ZJyI8arW2w0yeY/edit?usp=sharing)**. Please make a copy in Google Docs, and send your completed questionnaire to info@actonmass.org. If you have an opponent in your race, upon receipt of your application we will invite them to apply with a 1-week deadline to ensure a fair process. Select applicants will advance to the second and final round of the endorsement process consisting of a virtual interview with Act on Mass staff and/or Board members. Further instructions can be found in the questionnaire document.
