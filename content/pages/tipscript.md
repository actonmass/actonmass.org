# Encourage your State Rep to Support the Campaign

**Please call or email your State Rep to ask him/her to vote for the People's House Amendments. Or, thank them if they've already committed to do so.**

## Scripts for Calling your Rep

#### **1. Persuasion Script: For reps who have not yet committed to the People’s House Amendments**

Hi, my name is (NAME) and I'm a resident of your district at (ADDRESS/NEIGHBORHOOD) in (CITY).

I'm writing to ask that you vote in favor of three amendments to The House Rules package (H.3930) to make the State House more democratic and accessible to the public: making all committee votes public and available on the legislature’s website, ensuring reps and the public have 72 hours to read bills prior to a floor vote, and reinstating an 8-year term limit for the Speaker.

*[Include your own personal story (optional but encouraged) -*

*EXAMPLE:*

*Lack of transparency in the State House directly affects me and many others in my personal life.*

*I come from a working class background, and have been in the customer service and food industry for many years.*

*In 2018, the Grand Bargain bill to raise the minimum wage was held up in committee for months before a new version of it was taken up and voted on the same day. This version nixed time-and-a-half for workers on Sundays and holidays, and that directly affected me and my fellow co-workers.* 

*This lack of time on voting for bills is just one example of how lack of transparency in the State House directly hurts me and other fellow constituents.]*

I strongly feel these amendments would greatly improve the relationship between constituents and their representatives. The State House’s current lack of transparency is preventing the public from being involved with the democratic process, and its consolidation of power is impeding elected officials’ ability to represent their constituents. We can’t win the change we need without working people having a seat at the table. 

As a legislator who was elected to represent the voices of the district, I hope you will choose to empower your constituents and vote in favor of these three amendments. 

Thank you.

#### **2. Thank You Script: For reps who have committed to one or more of the People’s House Amendments**

Hi, my name is (NAME) and I'm a resident of your district at (ADDRESS/NEIGHBORHOOD) in (CITY). 

I'm writing to thank you for committing to vote in favor of the People’s House Amendment(s) to the House Rules proposal (H.3930) that would make the State House more transparent, accountable, and accessible to the public! Namely, \[making committee votes public / ensuring reps and the public have 72 hours to read bills prior to a floor vote / reinstating an 8-year term limit for the Speaker.]

I support these/this amendment(s) because these/this change(s) would make it easier for everyday people to be involved in the lawmaking process, and ensure their voices are being heard. Thank you for being courageous and fighting for your constituents and standing up for a more democratic State House. I am grateful that we have you as an ally in the fight to give working people a seat at the table. 

I look forward to your continued leadership on this issue!

Thank you.
