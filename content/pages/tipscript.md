**Persuasion Script**: For reps who have not yet committed to the People’s House Amendments

Hi, my name is (NAME) and I'm a resident of your district at (ADDRESS/NEIGHBORHOOD) in (CITY).

I'm writing to ask that you publicly commit to voting in favor of three amendments to the House Rule in July to make the State House more democratic and accessible to the public: making all committee votes public and posted on the legislature’s website, ensuring reps and the public have 72 hours to read bills prior to a floor vote, and reinstating an 8-year term limit for the Speaker.

*[Include your own personal story (optional but encouraged) -*

*EXAMPLE:*

*Lack of transparency in the State House directly affects me and many others in my personal life.*

*I come from a working class background, and have been in the customer service and food industry for many years.*

*In 2018, the Grand Bargain bill to raise the minimum wage was held up in committee for months before a new version of it was taken up and voted on the same day. This version nixed time-and-a-half for workers on Sundays and holidays, and that directly affected me and my fellow co-workers.* 

*This lack of time on voting for bills is just one example of how lack of transparency in the State House directly hurts me and other fellow constituents.]*

I strongly feel these amendments would greatly improve the relationship between constituents and their representatives. The State House’s current lack of transparency is preventing the public from being involved with the democratic process, and its consolidation of power is impeding elected officials’ ability to represent their constituents. We can’t win the change we need without working people having a seat at the table. 

As a legislator who was elected to represent the voices of the district, I hope you will choose to empower your constituents and vote in favor of these three amendments. 

Thank you.
