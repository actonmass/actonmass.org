# Adequate Time to Review

## What does the amendment do?

It requires the House to give all members and the public at least 72 hours to read and fully consider a bill before it can be voted on. This requirement can be waived by 2/3rds of all members voting yes. 

## Why does it matter?

The text of a bill as originally filed at the beginning of a session is almost never what reaches the floor, and for good reason: committees take testimony from the public, and suggest changes to the text as originally filed. But the changes a committee makes can be significant and far-reaching, and Reps and the public need enough time to read the new version of the bill and consider if they want to offer amendments to debate on the floor.

## Precedent

The U.S. Congress recently codified their own 72-hour rule. The Massachusetts Senate, too, has a rule that bills coming to a floor vote from Senate Ways and Means must be released 72 hours before a vote. Because most bills go through Ways and Means before a floor vote, this approximates a universal 72 hour requirement.

## What are the arguments against this?

1. "This would slow down the process too much and gum up the works"

* Bills sit in committee for months after having a hearing with no public action until suddenly a new bill draft is released and rushed to the floor. Asking for committees to release the bill 2-3 days earlier than they are used to wouldn't put an undue burden on those committees.
* In case of emergency or end of session crunch, 2/3rds of all members can simply vote to move forward with the bill faster. A roll call vote to suspend this rule can be done in only a few minutes.
* The current rules already require 24 hours for bills coming from House Ways & Means, this would simply give us adequate time to review a bill coming from any committee and extend that from 24 hours to 72 hours.

2. "The text of these bills are available to the public the moment they’re filed at the beginning of the session. Reps and the public have months to read bills before they’re voted on"

* The text of bills can change greatly in committee, and the new text isn't public until the committee releases it. 
* There are over 7000 bills filed every session. Even if a legislator worked 24/7 they could not keep up with all those bills in the 29 different joint committees.

5. "This is only something Republicans care about because it would help them filibuster Democratic priorities."

* Believing that Reps should have a chance to read a bill before voting on it isn't a partisan issue. Voters and legislators across the state care about this issue regardless of party. 



## Sample Amendment Language

\[Representative] moves to amend the order in Rule 33A by striking out the first paragraph and inserting in place thereof the following:- Copies of all bills shall be available, in the form in which they will be considered by the House, to all members of the House and the public at least 72 hours in advance of consideration by the House. The House may consider a bill that has not been so available for at least 72 hours only upon a roll call vote of two-thirds of House members present and voting. This rule shall not be suspended unless by unanimous consent of the members present.
