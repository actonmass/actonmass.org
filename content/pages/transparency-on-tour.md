# We're coming to your district this summer!

This summer, [Act on Mass](https://actonmass.org/) has set the ambitious goal to bring our grassroots movement for reform and our [Good Government Agenda](https://actonmass.org/good-government-agenda/) to citizens in every Senate district in the Commonwealth– all 40 of them. 

**Important links:** 

* We need lots of volunteer help this summer! Join us for a table, help us fill out "Accountability Cards," drive a carpool of other volunteers– fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZCgzKp7bQjuH3bTOpW1ZuUqg2-S4MmezogSBo_8x5MSgDRA/viewform?usp=dialog) to see upcoming opportunities and get plugged in! 
* Help us find a place to table in your district with [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0QTGcoLPT_j96J9rSAVu-5CqNSwPHAg-ofuFj4mIIugNwVg/viewform) 

**Why Transparency on Tour?**

* The success of [Question 1](https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/11/05/massachusetts-2024-president-senate-ballot-question-results) this fall demonstrated that citizens in every city and town in Massachusetts care about our government being transparent and accountable
* With the crisis at the federal level, a state government that is effective and responsive to the needs of its citizens is more important than ever
* Beacon Hill can seem worlds away, but the impacts of their inaction and lack of accountability are felt in communities across the Commonwealth. We want to ensure that all these areas have the tools necessary to explain what is happening and how to hold their representatives accountable for change
* Lastly, we have friends, allies, and supporters across Massachusetts who we don’t always get the chance to organize with in-person. Why not make a tour out of it?

**What will this look like?**

* The goal is to have Act on Mass volunteers, staff, and allies join with local organizations to table at community events or key locations and reach folks where they live to have open discussions about our state democracy, issues that matter to them, and what we can do about it
* We are excited about collaboration. If your organization has a key district to target or a key state-level issue you want to stump for, let us know. The lack of transparency and accountability in our state house affects many issues that we all care about and our movement for reform intends to make advocacy work easier. Let’s work together. 

**We’re looking for:** 

* Community fairs, farmers markets, town events, etc. to show up and speak with your neighbors! If you know of a good location for us to target, let us know [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0QTGcoLPT_j96J9rSAVu-5CqNSwPHAg-ofuFj4mIIugNwVg/viewform?usp=sharing). 
* Good government allies to join us in our push to hit all 40 districts! 

Looking forward to seeing you on the road this summer!
