### Our Campaign Strategy

A healthy democracy is more than a set of good governance reforms or changes to the rules. In order to have a robust representative democracy and to achieve our progressive legislative agenda, we need to build real grassroots power. The only way to make the State House work for everyday people, and not just corporate interests, is to hold our elected officials accountable to the will of their constituents. Right now, it is much easier for our legislators to go along with the status quo than it is to stick their neck out and risk souring their relationship with House leadership. Right now, most legislators feel far more beholden to the speaker or senate president than they are of their constituents. Our task as advocates is to turn that dynamic on its head. Remember - they work for us, not the other way around.

But building true grassroots power is easier said than done. At Act on Mass, we piloted an unusual campaign strategy with our Transparency is Power and The People's House campaigns. We didn't follow the normal advocacy playbook. Instead, we built a campaign around the objective of getting as many constituents as possible to have a face-to-face meeting with their rep, and making a hard ask of them. And then, we publicized which reps were with us, and turned up public pressure on those who weren't. 

This campaign strategy wasn't easy, and it seemed to rub some powerful people the wrong way. But it worked. After only 3 months of concerted organizing, we earned a major concession in the transparency of committee votes. We decided to take this strategy, as well as our learnings, our resources, templates, trainings, and all other internal documents that we generated over the course of the campaign, and make them available to the public. 

Whatever progressive bills or issues you're campaigning for, our hope is that this toolkit can help shape your organizing to build more, real, tangible, grassroots power.
