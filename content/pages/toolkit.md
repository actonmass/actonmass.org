# The Act on Mass Action Toolkit

A healthy democracy is more than a set of good governance reforms or changes to the rules. In order to have a robust representative democracy and to achieve our progressive legislative agenda, we need to build real grassroots power. The only way to make the State House work for everyday people, and not just corporate interests, is to hold our elected officials accountable to the will of their constituents. Unfortunately, it is much easier for our legislators to go along with the status quo than it is to stick their neck out and risk souring their relationship with House leadership. Right now, most legislators feel far more beholden to the speaker or senate president than they are of their constituents. Our task as advocates is to turn that dynamic on its head. Remember - they work for us.

### Our Campaign Strategy

But building true grassroots power is easier said than done. At Act on Mass, we piloted an unusual campaign strategy with our Transparency is Power and The People's House campaigns. Instead of following the normal advocacy playbook, we built a campaign around the objective of getting as many constituents as possible to have a face-to-face meeting with their rep, and making a hard ask. And then, we publicized which reps were with us, and turned up public pressure on those who weren't. 

It worked. After only 3 months of concerted organizing, we earned a major concession in the transparency of committee votes. Our strategy rubbed House leadership the wrong way - which is a good thing. If they weren't acutely feeling pressure from the public on this issue, they wouldn't have felt the need to offer a concession. In a nutshell, our campaign strategy is this: organize constituents, turn up the pressure, force a concession. Lather, rinse, repeat.

### Why a Toolkit?

We decided to take this strategy, as well as our learnings, our resources, templates, trainings, and all other internal documents that we generated over the course of the campaign, and make them available to the public. Whether you're an individual hoping to organize in your community or an established advocacy group trying to pass a major bill through the legislature, we hope this toolkit and campaign strategy can help you build the power you need to achieve your goals, as it's helped us achieve ours.
