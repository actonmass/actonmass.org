# Amendment #1: Make All Committee Votes Public

## What does the amendment do?

It requires all House-only committees to make their votes public on the website. Right now, most committee votes are taken via email, and are not made publicly available.

## Why does it matter?

A lot of important progressive bills die in committee each session without a record of how they were voted on. Not only does important policy not get passed, but the public doesn't know who opposed them. If we know who votes against our interests, we could at least set up meetings with those Reps and seek common ground. Popular bills like 100% Renewable Energy, Medicare for All, and protections for undocumented immigrants have all been killed in committee without a public vote.

## Precedent

On this issue, the Massachusetts House of Representatives is in the minority. 27 state governments require making their committee votes public. Even the Massachusetts State Senate made the Senate-only committee’s votes public years ago, which had passed unanimously. The Senate’s proposal for the Joint Rules in February 2021, too, included public committee votes. This was passed by the Senate without objection.

## What are the arguments against this?

1. "If anyone wants to know how I voted, they can call me and I'll tell them."

* * That's great, but there are approximately 43,000 people in each State Rep district. Does each one of them need to call their rep's office to find out how they voted?

* Why not automate this process?

2. "My committee makes these votes public."

* A few committees have adopted rules to make their own votes public upon request. That is a great start, but again, why should all the residents of the Commonwealth need to send an email request to see how their Reps voted? 27 other states publish votes on their website. Why not Massachusetts?

3. "All our committee votes are already disclosed in the House Journal."

* This isn't true. The House Journal shows only "dissents," which is an old, rarely used method for reps to indicate their disagreement with the committee's actions.

4. "People would vote differently - more conservatively - in committee if votes were public, because they’re afraid of a challenge from Republicans.”

* We are a representative democracy, and it's crucial for voters to know how their elected representatives are voting.
* Republican opponents are extremely unlikely to successfully unseat a Democratic incumbent in Massachusetts. Massachusetts already has among the [least competitive](https://ballotpedia.org/Annual_State_Legislative_Competitiveness_Report:_Vol._10,_2020) elections in the country, and in 2020, we had the [lowest rate](https://ballotpedia.org/Major_party_candidates_with_major_party_competition_in_the_November_2020_state_legislative_elections) of Republican challengers in the country.

## Sample Amendment Language

\[Representative] moves to amend the order in Rule 17B by inserting after line 500 the following paragraph:- All votes by the committee to give any legislation a favorable report, adverse report, or study order, whether by recorded vote at an executive session or by an electronic poll of the committee, shall be recorded on appropriate forms that show the names of all members voting in the affirmative, members voting in the negative, members not voting, and members reserving their rights, shall be kept in the offices of the committee, and shall be posted on the website of the General Court as soon as practicable; provided that votes may also be recorded in LAWS.
