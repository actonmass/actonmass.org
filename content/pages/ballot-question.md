# Question 6 passes in all 20 districts!

T﻿he question: "Shall the representative for this district be instructed to vote in favor of changes to the applicable House of Representative rules to make each legislator’s vote in that body's Legislative committees publicly available on the Legislature's website?"

T﻿hrough non-binding ballot question asking voters if they support public committee votes will be on the November 8th ballot in 20 state house districts. These non-binding ballot questions (also referred to as “policy questions”) don’t become law if passed, but rather serve as a way for constituents to directly and publicly tell their representative how they want them to vote on an issue. And, frankly, our movement has a lot to say
