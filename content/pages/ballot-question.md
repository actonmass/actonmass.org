# Question 6 Passed in all 20 Districts!

**Question 6 for public committee votes passed overwhelmingly in all 20 districts. See below for up-to-date vote tallies.**

As part of The People's House campaign for rules reform, we organized to put a non-binding policy question on 20 ballots across the Commonwealth. Our question asks voters if they support requiring legislators on Beacon Hill to make their committee votes public. 

T﻿he question language: "Shall the representative for this district be instructed to vote in favor of changes to the applicable House of Representative rules to make each legislator’s vote in that body's Legislative committees publicly available on the Legislature's website?"

Because this is a non-binding question, it doesn't become law if passed, but rather serves as a way for constituents to directly and publicly tell their representative how they want them to vote on an issue. And, frankly, our movement had a lot to say.

An average of 85% of voters across 20 districts voted YES to instruct their legislators to vote to make committee votes public. We're still waiting for some results to trickle in from town clerks, and we'll continue to update the results.
