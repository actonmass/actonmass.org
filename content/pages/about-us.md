      - We keep the State
      House honest by
      monitoring legislative
      proceedings and
      identifying when key
      bills are killed behind
      closed doors
      - We publish our findings
      online so that
      constituents can more
      effectively take action
      for policies that they
      believe in

  - title: Advocacy
    description: |
      - We are advocates for
      public disclosure,
      transparency in
      lawmaking, and a
      democracy that is
      responsive to the voices
      of the many
      - We believe that a
      healthy democracy
      centers constituents
      and actively
      deemphasizes corporate
      interests

  - title: Organizing
    description: |
      - We believe that casting a
      vote for an elected official
      is only the first step in a
      participatory democracy
      - We also know that
      advocating for policies that
      our lives depend on is time
      consuming and daunting
      - Act on Mass creates
      campaigns for constituents
      to organize in their
      communities, trains
      community members, and
      organizes alongside them
