#### What if we could make the State House work to uplift the lives of millions, fulfilling the needs of our most vulnerable neighbors? **Imagine what transformative policies we could win.**

  In July, the Massachusetts State House will be writing its own rulebook. We’re organizing
  constituent power in every corner of the state to ask that our legislators change the broken,
  anti-democratic rules in the State House. Together, we can make the State House the People’s House.
  Will you join us?

## The Massachusetts State House is Broken

<TwoSidedBlock>

<Block>

As Massachusetts residents, we know that our state house is not working for us. Year after year,
policies that the **majority of people in this state support** and need in order to thrive are voted
down without a public vote, or stalled indefinitely. This is true of vital legislation such as [immigrant protections](https://actonmass.org/issues/immigration/), [Medicare for All](https://actonmass.org/bills/medicare-for-all/), [increasing voting access](https://actonmass.org/issues/voting-rights/), [ending wage theft](https://actonmass.org/bills/stop-wage-theft/), and so much more.

Why is it that, despite a Democratic supermajority, the State House fails to pass widely popular and
desperately needed legislation?

## The Problem: The People Have Been Locked Out

<TwoSidedBlock>
<CenteredImage img="/img/campaign-locked-out.png" alt="" width="500"/>
<Block>

  We elect representatives to represent our interests, but the truth is, most of the time **we
  don’t even know how they vote on our behalf.** In fact, Massachusetts has
  [one of the least transparent state houses in the country](https://ballotpedia.org/Open_States%27_Legislative_Data_Report_Card). For ordinary residents, this means that:

* It's difficult to know what's going on in the State House, and advocate for the bills we care
  about.
* Our representatives are more accountable to corporate lobbyists and the Speaker of the House than
  to their districts.

  Democracy only works if everyday people are able to access and influence their government.

## The Solution: Build Constituent Power to Change the Broken Rules

<TwoSidedBlock>

<Block>

  **Constituents are united behind the need for a more transparent and accessible State House.** By
  activating this support to call for transparency, accountability and shared power in the State House
  rulebook, we can win a State House that truly works for all of us.

  Our strategy is to model the representative democracy we’d like to see in our state by empowering thousands
  of constituents to organize their communities, meet with their representatives, and lobby for changes to the House Rules. Together, we’re calling for three common sense reforms that will allow constituents to have a voice in the government that shapes our daily lives:

## History behind the campaign

In November of 2020, Act on Mass launched the Transparency is Power campaign. Between November and
February, over 3000 constituents in 150 districts across the state and dozens of advocacy
organizations joined our campaign for a more transparent state house. Largely in reaction to the
power that our movement built, the Speaker of the House decided to delay the rules vote by six
months. During the Joint Rules vote in February, House Leadership made a major concession in their proposal in direct response to the public pressure generated by the campaign. Because of our grassroots movement, "no" votes in Joint committees will be available online. This partial victory is a huge step towards a State House that is transparent, accessible, and accountable to the people.
