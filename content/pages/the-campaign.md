## History behind the campaign

In November of 2020, Act on Mass launched the Transparency is Power campaign. In April, we joined in
coalition with Sunrise Boston, Mijente Boston Asamblea, Indivisible Mass, and Our Climate to form
The People's House. Between November and July, over 4000 constituents in all 160 districts across
the state and over 60 advocacy organizations joined our movement for a more transparent state house.
We organized and built momentum in anticipation of key Rules debates in the House. In both the Joint
Rules vote in February and the House Rules vote in July, House Leadership made a major concession in
their proposal in direct response to the public pressure generated by the campaign. Because of our
grassroots movement, "no" votes in Joint and House committees will be available online. While our
three amendments were voted down, we successfully changed the landscape of this issue here in
Massachusetts. This partial victory is a huge step towards a State House that is transparent,
accessible, and accountable to the people. But there is more work to be done! Join us as we continue
our campaign for a healthy democracy.
